It survived plans for its demolition in the 1970s and was completely refurbished in the mid-1980s, when its neoclassical facade was fully restored and the pitch was lowered by 11 metres to allow new rows of seating to be installed. Situated on Montjuïc, the hill that overlooks the city, it became the focal point of the 1992 Olympic Games, since when it has been used for both sporting and non-sporting events. From 1997 to 2009, it was the home ground of football club RCD Espanyol. It staged the 2010 European Athletics Championships and the 2012 IAAF World Junior Championships. In recent years, it has hosted major music concerts and has been used as a sports theme park. Plans for its future use are under discussion."

The venue hosted fewer sporting events after the Games due to the construction of the Palau Sant Jordi and was repurposed in 2000 to stage theatre productions and concerts. It staged its last production in 2017 and was closed thereafter due to structural damage. In 2021, Barcelona City Council announced plans to convert it into a sports technology and innovation centre that will form part of the Barcelona Sports Tech Hub initiative.

From 1997 to 2009, it was the home ground of football club RCD Espanyol. It staged the 2010 European Athletics Championships and the 2012 IAAF World Junior Championships.

The venue was remodelled for the 1992 Olympic Games, with its parquet flooring replaced with a synthetic surface to meet the needs of the volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics competitions. The venue hosted fewer sporting events after the Games due to the construction of the Palau Sant Jordi and was repurposed in 2000 to stage theatre productions and concerts. It staged its last production in 2017 and was closed thereafter due to structural damage. In 2021, Barcelona City Council announced plans to convert it into a sports technology and innovation centre that will form part of the Barcelona Sports Tech Hub initiative. The schedule for the venue's conversion has yet to be announced.",
