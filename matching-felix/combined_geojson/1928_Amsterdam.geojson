The venue attracts around 1.4 million visitors a year and will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2023 World Gymnaestrada, a non-competition event organised by the International Gymnastics Federation. Over 30 companies and organisations have their offices at the stadium, including the Johan Cruyff Foundation.\n\nBuilt for the Games, the stadium was designed to host a number of different events, including football, athletics and cycling. It was regularly used as a football venue after the Games, staging the 1962 European Cup Final between Benfica and Real Madrid and, between 1934 and 1996, European club competition ties involving AFC Ajax. When the city council drew up plans for the stadium's demolition in the late 1980s, a campaign was organised to save it and ultimately led to it being listed as a national monument."
