It is still used regularly today and has been refurbished on several occasions. It now stages sporting events such as the Diamond League and the Stockholm Marathon, as well as major concerts. The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and AC/DC are just some of the acts to have performed at the venue. The venue for the city's Olympic Jubilee celebrations in 2012, it is also used for cross-country skiing in the winter months, when three 430-metre tracks are laid out. The stadium was also a stand-in venue at the Olympic Games Melbourne / Stockholm 1956, staging some of the equestrian events, which had to be held outside Australia due to the country's strict quarantine laws for horses."
