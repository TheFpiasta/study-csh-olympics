It also featured a heated indoor pool, a fencing gym and wrestling, weightlifting and boxing facilities. In the decades that followed, it served as a major concert venue and as a temporary home for Rome's top football clubs, AS Roma and SS Lazio, during the Stadio Olimpico's renovation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. It was also the venue for the Italian national rugby team's home Six Nations games between 2000 and 2011, at which point the stadium was closed. Empty and neglected since then, it has survived demolition plans and was awarded funds for refurbishment as part of a major urban renewal plan that includes the regeneration of the Olympic Village.",
