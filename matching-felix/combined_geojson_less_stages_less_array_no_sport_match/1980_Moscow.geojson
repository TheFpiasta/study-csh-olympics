Renovations included the installation of two large video scoreboards and floodlights with halogen lamps to enable high-quality broadcasting in poor light conditions. The stadium was further renovated in 1996, when its roof structure was upgraded. Visited by 10,000 people a day for sport and recreation purposes, the stadium has since hosted the 1998 World Youth Games, the 2008 UEFA Champions League final, the 2013 IAAF World Athletics Championships and the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, an event for which it was fully renovated and turned into a bespoke football stadium with a capacity of 81,000. It also stages cultural events and concerts by leading international acts."

The stadium was further renovated in 1996, when its roof structure was upgraded. Visited by 10,000 people a day for sport and recreation purposes, the stadium has since hosted the 1998 World Youth Games, the 2008 UEFA Champions League final, the 2013 IAAF World Athletics Championships and the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, an event for which it was fully renovated and turned into a bespoke football stadium with a capacity of 81,000.
