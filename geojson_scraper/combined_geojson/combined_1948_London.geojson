It enjoyed its heyday in the 1920s and 30s, when events such as the Good Friday Meeting attracted crowds of up to 12,000. Though in regular use after the 1948 Olympic Games, it was threatened with closure in 2010 due to the poor state of the facilities. The velodrome was extensively refurbished between 2011 and 2017, when the 450m banked asphalt track received a completely new surface, floodlights were installed, and a new pavilion was built to accommodate new changing rooms, offices, a café and bike storage facilities.
