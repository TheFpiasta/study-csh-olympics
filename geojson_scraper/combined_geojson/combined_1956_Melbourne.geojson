In preparation for the 1956 Olympic Games, a temporary athletics track was installed and a new stand built. The athletics track was removed as soon as the Games were over.\n\nKnown locally as \"The G\", Melbourne Cricket Ground remains one of the temples of world cricket. It is also a major venue for Australian rules football, hosting the season's showpiece match, the Grand Final. The MCG staged matches at the women's and men's Olympic football tournaments at Sydney 2000, and the opening and closing ceremonies and track and field events at the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. A venue for concerts and international rugby and baseball matches as well, it is also the home of the Australian Sports Museum.\n\nThe venue was renovated between 2004 and 2006. The stand built for the 1956 Games was demolished, along with neighbouring stands, to make way for a new North Stand, which took the stadium's capacity to 101,000. A new roof was also added to the stadium. The vast South Stand, which opened in 1992 and has a capacity of 45,000, was modernised in 2012.",
