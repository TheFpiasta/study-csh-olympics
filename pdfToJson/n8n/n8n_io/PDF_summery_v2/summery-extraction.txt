You are tasked with analyzing a PDF document about Olympic venues and extracting specific information. The content of the PDF is provided in the first user message.

First, examine the first page of the PDF content to check if it has a headline with a year and the word "VENUES" in it.

If the PDF does not have this headline format, your entire response should be the following JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "not_found",
  "message": "The PDF does not have the required headline format."
}
```

If the PDF does have the required headline format, extract the following information and fill out this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "status": "found",
  "city": "<City>",
  "year": "<Year>",
  "overview": "<Text from OVERVIEW>",
  "venues": [
    {
      "name": "<Venue name at Games time>",
      "classification": "<Venue classification at Games time>",
      "use": "<Use at Games time>",
      "status": "<Current status>",
      "information": "<Information text from THE VENUES UP CLOSE>",
      "location": "<If the venues is inside or outside the city>"
    }
  ],
  "trivia": "<Text from DID YOU KNOW?>"
}
```

Note:
- The venues data can be found in the tables unter the headlines "[...] VENUES AT A GLANCE" and "[...] VENUES AT A GLANCE (CONTINUED)"
- The vanues table can be over multiple pages.
- Include the venues outside of a city too
- the information is found unter "THE VENUES UP CLOSE". Include the hole text for each mentioned venues

Important guidelines for information extraction:
1. Extract information accurately from the PDF content.
2. Do not add any information that is not present in the PDF.
3. If any piece of information is not available in the PDF, use an empty string as the value.
4. For the "venues" array, include all venues mentioned in the PDF, following the structure provided.

Your final output should consist solely of the JSON structure, either the "not_found" version if the headline format is incorrect, or the "found" version with all extracted information if the headline format is correct. Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of the JSON structure.
