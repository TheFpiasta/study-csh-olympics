To mark the 50th anniversary of these Olympic Winter Games, a giant mural covering an area of 300 square metres was painted on the side of one of the Media Centre buildings. Based on inputs from local residents, it features scenes from the Games, including a portrait of the great French skier Jean-Claude Killy, who won three Alpine skiing gold medals at Grenoble 1968. The Grenoble 1968 Olympic cauldron still stands in the Parc Paul Mistral today. A stand-alone venue that hosted the men's large hill competition, the ski jumping hill at Saint-Nizier was built in such a way that ski jumpers appeared to be flying over nearby Grenoble when they took off. The images caught by the world's photographers at the Olympic Winter Games helped market the city and promote it as the \\\"Capital of the Alps\\\".

The rest were built for the Games. The Olympic venues suffered damage to varying degrees during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995. Most have been restored to their original use and modernised since then, partly thanks to international support. Visitors and local residents continue to use them for a wide range of winter and summer sports.\n\nAlthough the ski jumps and sliding track can no longer be used for winter sports, the sites where they are located host a wide variety of other sporting and cultural activities. For example, the reopening, in 2018, of the cable car connecting the city to the top of Mount Trebević has allowed more people to access the area for hiking and other pursuits. Since then, the number of hotels, restaurants, recreation centres, etc. has grown alongside the number of visitors.\n\nAn existing venue, Koševo Stadium, hosted the Opening Ceremony. It continues to be used as a venue for track and field, football and rugby. The Olympic Hall of the newly built Zetra Complex staged the Closing Ceremony. A multi-purpose facility, it is used for sports and other events.\n\nAn Olympic Village was built for the Games, in the Mojmilo district. It was renovated after the war and is fully occupied today.",
