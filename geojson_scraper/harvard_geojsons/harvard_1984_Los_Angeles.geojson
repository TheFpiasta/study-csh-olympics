The stadium was built in 1921 on the site of an abandoned racecourse in the city's Exposition Park. It hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and track and field events when the city staged the Olympic Games for the first time in 1932, when its capacity was 105,000. It will perform that function again, with the exception of some field events, when the Games return to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nNamed Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, in honour of local World War One veterans, the stadium has been the home of the University of Southern California (USC)'s sports teams, among them the Trojans, USC's American football team, since it opened. It has provided the setting for two Super Bowls, several World Series baseball matches, and four US Olympic track and field trials. The Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Dodgers are just some of the many sports teams who have called the stadium home at some time or other in its history. Figures such as John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and Billy Graham have all addressed large crowds at the stadium, which has also played host to the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Bruce Springsteen and Prince, among other major acts. The stadium underwent a major refurbishment in 2019.",
