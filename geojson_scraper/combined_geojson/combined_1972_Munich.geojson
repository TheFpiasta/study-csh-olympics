The venue's grass terraces can accommodate crowds of between 8,000 and 10,000.\n\nThe course was first used as a canoe slalom venue in the 1950s. In preparation for Munich 1972, a sculpted concrete floor was created in the channel and the course was made steeper. Water flow from the weir at the top of the channel can be controlled to provide the necessary canoeing conditions. As a result, the course does not use pumps, making it more cost-efficient to run. Since 2019, the Olympic canoe slalom course has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Augsburg.",
