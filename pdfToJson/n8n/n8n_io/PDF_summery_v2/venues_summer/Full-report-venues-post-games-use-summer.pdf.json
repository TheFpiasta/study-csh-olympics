After WWII, the Village was used as accommodation for Russian and Soviet soldiers and their families, though the only buildings that remained by that time were the House of Nations, the sports and swim halls, and the halls that had housed the Swiss, Turkish and US athletes. When the Cold War ended, the site was abandoned and vandalised. A fire destroyed the swim hall in 1993, at which point the Village was listed as a protected heritage site. Some of the buildings were later renovated and opened to the public.

After WWII, the Village was used as accommodation for Russian and Soviet soldiers and their families, though the only buildings that remained by that time were the House of Nations, the sports and swim halls, and the halls that had housed the Swiss, Turkish and US athletes. When the Cold War ended, the site was abandoned and vandalised. A fire destroyed the swim hall in 1993, at which point the Village was listed as a protected heritage site. Some of the buildings were later renovated and opened to the public.

Aside from one temporary venue, all the other competition venues were existing. No Olympic Village was built either, out of a desire to keep costs low in a country still recovering from WWII. Of the nine venues no longer in use, five are football stadiums. The temporary venue was dismantled after the Games. Empire Stadium, now Wembley Stadium, hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the athletics competitions. Two of the venues had been used at the 1908 Olympic Games (Henley Royal Regatta Course and Bisley Rifle Range), while three were used at London 2012: Empire Stadium (Wembley), Empire Pool (Wembley Arena) and Empress Hall (Earl's Court).",

The stadium has on occasion provided London football clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur with a temporary home, and it has been used for several other sports over the years, including rugby league, rugby union, American football, speedway, boxing and baseball. It is also a celebrated concert venue and was the setting for the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. It also hosts corporate events and offers guided tours for visitors. One of the two physical remnants of the 1948 Olympic Games is Olympic Way, since renamed Wembley Way. A half-mile approach to the stadium leading from the nearest London Underground station, it was built for the Games and channels spectators in their thousands to the stadium's gates. The other is the Olympic Roll of Honour, two large plaques commemorating the gold medallists at the 1948 Olympic Games and set in the walls on either side of the Royal Tunnel. The plaques were removed and kept safe when the stadium was demolished in 2003 and returned to Wembley in time for the 2012 Olympic Games, as part of an exhibition at the new stadium.",

Of the nine venues no longer in use, five are football stadiums. The temporary venue was dismantled after the Games. Empire Stadium, now Wembley Stadium, hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the athletics competitions. Two of the venues had been used at the 1908 Olympic Games (Henley Royal Regatta Course and Bisley Rifle Range), while three were used at London 2012: Empire Stadium (Wembley), Empire Pool (Wembley Arena) and Empress Hall (Earl's Court).\",\n  \"venues\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Empire Stadium (Wembley)\",\n      \"classification\": \"Existing\",\n      \"use\": \"Athletics, Opening and Closing Ceremonies\",\n      \"status\": \"In use (rebuilt)\",\n      \"information\": \"Built for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924/25, the stadium hosted its first FA Cup final in 1923 and remains the venue for this showpiece match and for the League Cup final today.

The stadium has on occasion provided London football clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur with a temporary home, and it has been used for several other sports over the years, including rugby league, rugby union, American football, speedway, boxing and baseball. It is also a celebrated concert venue and was the setting for the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. It also hosts corporate events and offers guided tours for visitors. One of the two physical remnants of the 1948 Olympic Games is Olympic Way, since renamed Wembley Way. A half-mile approach to the stadium leading from the nearest London Underground station, it was built for the Games and channels spectators in their thousands to the stadium's gates. The other is the Olympic Roll of Honour, two large plaques commemorating the gold medallists at the 1948 Olympic Games and set in the walls on either side of the Royal Tunnel.

It is also a major venue for Australian rules football, hosting the season's showpiece match, the Grand Final. The MCG staged matches at the women's and men's Olympic football tournaments at Sydney 2000, and the opening and closing ceremonies and track and field events at the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. A venue for concerts and international rugby and baseball matches as well, it is also the home of the Australian Sports Museum.\n\nThe venue was renovated between 2004 and 2006. The stand built for the 1956 Games was demolished, along with neighbouring stands, to make way for a new North Stand, which took the stadium's capacity to 101,000. A new roof was also added to the stadium. The vast South Stand, which opened in 1992 and has a capacity of 45,000, was modernised in 2012.",

The Small Sports Palace (Palazzetto dello Sport) was built by the celebrated Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi, who also designed the Torino Esposizioni, which hosted ice hockey matches at the Olympic Winter Games Torino 2006. Occupying the crater of an ancient volcano, Lake Albano gave its name to a lane-marking system devised to respond to the challenges that the depth of the water posed. The anchor-based system commonly used at the time was rendered impractical by the lake, which was up to 170 metres deep in places. In response to this, the Albano system uses buoys and cables and can be installed on any suitable body of water, regardless of its depth. It was later adopted as the universal standard by the world governing bodies of canoeing and rowing, and it remains in use today. The streets of the Olympic Village are named after the famous sporting figures and national delegations that stayed there. They include Via Chile, Via India, Via Nedo Nadi (a celebrated Italian fencer) and Viale Pietro de Coubertin. The plan to redevelop Flaminio Stadium aims to make it a major concert venue, the permanent home of Italian rugby, and the home of SS Lazio's club museum."

The Small Sports Palace (Palazzetto dello Sport) was built by the celebrated Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi, who also designed the Torino Esposizioni, which hosted ice hockey matches at the Olympic Winter Games Torino 2006. Occupying the crater of an ancient volcano, Lake Albano gave its name to a lane-marking system devised to respond to the challenges that the depth of the water posed. The anchor-based system commonly used at the time was rendered impractical by the lake, which was up to 170 metres deep in places. In response to this, the Albano system uses buoys and cables and can be installed on any suitable body of water, regardless of its depth. It was later adopted as the universal standard by the world governing bodies of canoeing and rowing, and it remains in use today. The streets of the Olympic Village are named after the famous sporting figures and national delegations that stayed there. They include Via Chile, Via India, Via Nedo Nadi (a celebrated Italian fencer) and Viale Pietro de Coubertin. The plan to redevelop Flaminio Stadium aims to make it a major concert venue, the permanent home of Italian rugby, and the home of SS Lazio's club museum.\"\n}\n```"

The stadium's main entrance is adorned by a vast natural stone mural created by celebrated Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The Olympic Stadium set new design standards and provided the inspiration for Rome's Olympic Stadium and Tokyo's National Stadium, built respectively for the 1960 and 1964 Olympic Games. The Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome was once one of the fastest tracks in the world and saw no fewer than 30 world records set before its wooden track was replaced by a concrete one in 1997.

The stadium's main entrance is adorned by a vast natural stone mural created by celebrated Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The Olympic Stadium set new design standards and provided the inspiration for Rome's Olympic Stadium and Tokyo's National Stadium, built respectively for the 1960 and 1964 Olympic Games. The Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome was once one of the fastest tracks in the world and saw no fewer than 30 world records set before its wooden track was replaced by a concrete one in 1997.
