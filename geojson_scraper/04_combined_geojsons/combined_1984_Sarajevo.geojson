Mount Trebević was a feared place during the 1,425-day siege of Sarajevo, offering clear vantage points for attacking the city below. The mountain was declared a national park in 2014 and reopened to the public in 2017, following more than 15 years of work to clear its slopes of abandoned military hardware and the thousands of mines laid during the war.\n\nThe graffiti-covered bobsleigh and luge track on Mount Trebević has become one of Sarajevo's cultural landmarks, and attracts lovers of street art from all over the world.\n\nWith the aid of volunteers, the national bobsleigh federation and a grant from the International Luge Federation, the ZOI'84 Olympic Legacy Foundation began restoration work on the badly damaged track in 2014. Though it remains unfit for official sliding sports competitions, it is used for extreme cycling and as a summer luge training venue.",
