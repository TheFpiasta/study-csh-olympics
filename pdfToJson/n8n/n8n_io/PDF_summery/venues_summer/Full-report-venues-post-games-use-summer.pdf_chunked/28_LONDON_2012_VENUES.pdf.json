Out of the eleven temporary venues, nine have been dismantled. One of the existing venues was demolished. Twenty venues remain in use today, including two temporary ones which became permanent. Eight of the venues were outside London. The venues still in use host sports, cultural, entertainment and leisure activities, cater for athletes of all levels of ability, and stage competitions that range from world championships to school events. The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the track and field competitions. The Olympic Village was built for the Games. Both are still in use.",

Now known as the O2 Arena, it has hosted more than 2,000 events, for which over 25 million tickets have been sold. At 20,000, it has the second-highest capacity for an indoor arena in the UK.

This reconfiguration took place between 2013 and 2016. A new roof covering all the seats was installed, along with retractable seating to cover the athletics track and bring the crowd closer to the pitch. The capacity was reduced from 80,000 to approximately 60,000, though the venue can host 80,000 for concerts. As well as hosting the 2017 IAAF World Championships and matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the stadium became the new home ground of English Premier League club West Ham United, ensuring its continued use. Despite its revamp, the stadium has been criticised because of high post-Games refurbishment costs, and the deal struck between the Mayor of London and West Ham United, which some believe has left taxpayers to fund a high amount of the club's stadium operating costs."
