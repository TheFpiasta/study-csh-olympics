Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesI N T RO DUCT IO N

This report shares the results of the first ever inventory of the post-Games use of Olympic venues. We 
tracked the post-Games use of 923 Olympic venues at 51 summer and winter editions of the Olympic 
Games, from Athens 1896 to PyeongChang 2018.

For over 125 years, the Olympic Games have served as a celebration of humanity and helped to build 
a better world through sport. For the hosting communities, they can create jobs, contribute to the 
regeneration of cities and regions, and increase the opportunities for people to enjoy sport and physical 
activity. Providing upgraded or new sports venues are one of the many ways the Olympic Games create a 
legacy for their host.

What happens to Olympic venues when the Games come to an end? How many of them are still in use 
and serve their local communities? What are the best practices? How can we maximise the chances of 
success?

Learning from past experience can help us shape a better future. By looking at the post-Games use of 
venues that hosted the Olympic Games in the past, we wanted to understand better the likelihood of 
continued use beyond the Games. We identified key lessons, best practices and more opportunities for 
Olympic hosts to derive the maximum benefit from their venues in the years to come.

With Olympic Agenda 2020 we reimagined how the Olympic Games are organised. We provided more 
flexibility in designing the Games to meet the long-term development plans of a host city/region. The 
changes include ensuring that hosting territories would make the most of existing venues and only build 
new ones when a robust legacy plan exists. The results can be seen for the two editions elected after 
Olympic Agenda 2020. At Paris 2024, 95 per cent of the venues will be existing or temporary, while Los 
Angeles 2028 can host the Games without building a single new permanent venue thanks to its “radical 
reuse” concept.

The first chapter of this report presents the methodology of the inventory, and is followed by a chapter 
presenting the key findings from the inventory, looking at the full scope of the 125 years of Olympic venues 
and their post-Games use. The 51 chapters in the sequence present the post-Games use of the venues 
for each Olympic Games edition, one by one.

For each Games, the inventory is presented in the form of a summary table and graphics, with essential 
information on venue classification and current use status (pre-COVID-19) for all venues hosting medal 
events, Opening/Closing Ceremonies and Olympic Villages. There is then additional information on the 
post-Games use for a selection of individual venues, together with specific features of their use and 
relevant changes over time.

This report was assured by a third-party according to the audit standard ISAE 3000. The assurance report 
from KPMG can be found in Appendix 2.

The inventory involved a mixed-methods approach. Mixed-methods research uses multiple ways to 
explore a research problem and combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research. 

SC O P E O F T H E I N V E N TO RY

In the context of the Olympic Games, a venue is any major Games site that hosts competitions or other
primary Games events and activities. For the purposes of this inventory, we included all competition 
venues that have hosted an Olympic Games medal event, the Opening/Closing Ceremony venues, 
and the Olympic Villages. Exhibition sports and their venues are not part of the inventory. Youth Olympic 
Games are not included. Venues that only hosted Paralympic events are not included.

We looked at all the venues staging events in all sports and disciplines, at all the Games of the Olympiad 
and Olympic Winter Games of the modern era, from Athens 1896 to PyeongChang 2018.

We covered a total of 923 venues, spread across four continents, in over 20 countries. 

The main information sources for the list of venues were the Official Reports of the Olympic Games or 
official publications from the Organising Committees (available on the Olympic World Library). When 
Official Reports were not sufficient (incomplete or conflicting information), the sport explanatory booklets 
were also used to cross-check or complete information. Olympedia, a website created by a group 
of dedicated Olympic historians and statisticians called the OlyMadMen, was also used as a source, 
especially for venues’ geographical coordinates and to cross-check the list of venues.

VE NUE CLA SSIFICATION  (CONSTRUCTION S TATUS  AT THE  TIM E OF  HOS T 
S ELECTI ON)
Venue classification refers to the construction status at the time of the host city/territory selection to host 
the Games. Venues can be either temporary or permanent. A permanent venue is intended to last a long 
time. In contrast, a temporary building is suitable for a short period of use and is not intended to remain. 
Permanent venues can be either existing or new.

E x ist i n g Pe r m a n e nt Ve n u e
The venue already existed when the host city/territory was selected to host the Games. The venue 
required no major changes or construction ahead of the Games.

N e w  Pe r m a n e nt  Ve n u e
The venue did not exist before the host city was selected to host the Games. The venue was intended to 
be permanent, and its construction was initiated/accelerated by the Games.

Te m p o r a r y Ve n u e
The venue was constructed for the Games, and, when the Games were over, the site was returned to its 
previous condition.

The main source for venue classification was the Official Reports. Other sources used were the websites 
of  resident clubs, website of the owner or operator of the venues, press articles, articles or blogs by 
amateur historians or fan clubs, and Wikipedia where the sources were listed.

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesBecause temporary venues were meant to be dismantled after the Olympic Games, they were excluded 
from the analysis of post-Games use in the key findings. Nevertheless, they were part of the identification 
process of the venue classification and were addressed in a qualitative manner in the chapters dedicated 
to each Olympic Games edition.

CURRENT USE STATUS
Current status refers to the post-Games use, or lack of use, of the venue. There are multiple potential
uses of Olympic venues. For the purposes of this inventory, we considered the uses identified in Preuss et 
al. (2014)2 in the dimension “Stadium in use” which includes classic use as a sports facility, event location 
or tourist attraction. To this, we added the use as a business, military, cultural or educational facility.

The reference period for “current use status” assessment is the two years before the COVID-19 
pandemic, i.e. 2018, 2019 and early 2020 (before COVID-19 lockdown). 

The current use status can be “in use”, “not in use” or “dismantled”.

IN USE 
The venue is regularly3 used for sport (practice, training and competition) and/or for non-sport activities 
(culture, leisure, entertainment, community or business). 

NOT IN USE 
The venue is not used regularly either for sport (practice, training and competition) or non-sport activities 
(culture, leisure, entertainment, community or business).

DATA C O L L ECT I O N

Initial desk research was combined with in-situ data collection (direct observation) and stakeholder 
consultations. 

DESK RESEARCH
Desk research was initially conducted in English and French. Where necessary, additional desk research 
was conducted in the native language of the host country for the following languages: German, Italian, 
Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

The following steps were taken when collecting data on current use status through desk research:

• 
• 

• 
• 

Identifying if the venue had an official website and/or active social media accounts where possible.
If not, or if the venue belonged to a city/municipality, the website of the city was used to see if activities 
were offered at the venue (e.g. for a swimming pool).
If the venue was privately owned/operated, the website of the owner/operator identified was used.
If no information was found, maps and pictures available in the official publications of the Games and 
satellite images and interactive panoramas (e.g. Google Images and Street View) were compared to 
determine whether the building still exists.

Academic literature was used where available: for instance, articles dealing with the post-Games use or 
legacy of the venues.

For each set of data captured on current use status, we assessed the reliability of the source and cross-
checked data from multiple sources (official websites, events websites, city tourism information website, 
etc).

IN SITU DATA COLLECTION 
In-situ data collection (direct observation) was carried out for a sample of 244 venues (a statistically 
significant sample for categorical data)4, representing 26 per cent of the venues studied.

For each venue for which in-situ data collection was available, a cross-check procedure was applied. A 
non-probability sampling technique, purposive sampling, was used to select the venues, based on the 
following criteria:
•  Venues located in territories with a native language not spoken by anyone in the research team. 

Venues in Japan, China, South Korea, Russia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Norway were 
targeted.

•  Venues in Games editions for which we found conflicting information during the desk research.
•  Venues whose ownership and operations had changed recently.
•  Editions from different time periods – pre-war; mid 20th century, late 20th century, 21st century.

STA K E H O L D E R C O N S U LTAT I O N S

The inventory results were reviewed by local stakeholders – venue owners/operators, legacy entities, 
city/ regional governments, National Olympic Committees – for their respective editions. We received 
feedback for 89 per cent of the venues.

Additional stakeholder consultations were carried out with industry professionals and experts.

ST U DY L I M I TAT I O N S 

As with the majority of studies, this inventory is subject to limitations. 

The first concerns the fact that the  information available about Olympic Games venues in the sources is 
not homogeneous by either type of venue. 

The criteria for defining a “venue” vary across the 125 years that separate Athens 1896 from 
PyeongChang 2018. Some editions considered a venue from a field of play perspective, while others 
considered a venue from the support infrastructure perspective. This has an impact on their classification 
as “new”, “existing” or “temporary”. We addressed this limitation by following the classification of the 
Official Report (e.g. field of play or supporting infrastructure). Where the Official Report also provided a 
classification, we would either adopt it if aligned with the definitions in this study, or change it to remain 
consistent across this report.

The second limitation relates to the lack of a single criterion applicable to all different venues to assess 
whether a venue is used regularly. During our research, it very soon became clear that the assessment 
of use status had a qualitative dimension. We addressed this limitation through: 1) a conversion mixed 
research design, transforming qualitative assessment into quantitative data; 2) the adoption of a decision 
tree to bring consistency to the qualitative assessment; 3) the discussion of any “borderline cases” with 
an internal review panel (extended four eye principle); and 4) a review of the inventory results by local 
stakeholders. 

Third, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the use of venues. Therefore, the “current” use status 
at the time of publication – April 2022 – may differ from the use status in the inventory, which refers 
to the years 2018, 2019 and the first few months of 2020 (before the pandemic was declared on 11 
March 2020).

*  All 51 editions of the Olympic Games between Athens 1896 and PyeongChang 2018 are included.

There are multiple potential uses of Olympic venues. For the purpose 
of this inventory, we considered the following uses: as a sports facility 
(training, competition, leisure sport), as an event location, as a tourist 
attraction, and as a business, cultural or educational facility. 

The reference period used for the “current use status” assessment is the 
two years before the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. 2018, 2019 and early 2020 
(before COVID-19 lockdown). 

Of the 15 per cent of permanent venues not in use (124 venues), the 
majority (88 venues) were unbuilt or demolished for a variety of reasons. 
Some had reached the end of their life, some were destroyed during 
war periods or in accidents, while others were replaced by new urban 
development projects or were removed for lack of a business model.  
The remaining venues not in use are closed or abandoned (36 venues).

Temporary venues were also used in the early editions of the Olympic 
Games – early 20th century – for different reasons. At the time, the 
technical requirements of competitions allowed for simpler configurations 
of the fields of play. The number of athletes and spectators were also 
smaller, thus requiring less complex structures. 

With technological advances and increased availability of new materials, 
temporary structures can fulfill more complex technical requirements for 
both field of play and spectator stands. Olympic Games hosts of the 21st 
century have taken the opportunity to use temporary venues when there 
was no long-term need for new permanent ones. 

Through Agenda 2020, the IOC actively encourages hosts to use 
temporary facilities. We will therefore see the consolidation of the trend 
towards increased use of temporary venues.

Seven competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Athens 1896, five 
of which remain in use today. Three of the competition venues were existing, three 
were new and one was temporary. Along with the temporary venue, one of the 
new venues has been demolished. The three existing venues all remain in use.

Most of the venues continue to host elite sporting events, with two of them staging 
competitions at the Olympic Games Athens 2004 and a third used as the main 
communications centre for that event. Some are also open to visitors and host 
events such as conferences and concerts.

An eighth venue was set up to host the Athens 1896 rowing competition,but this 
was cancelled due to stormy conditions. The venue is still in use. An existing 
venue, the Panathenaic Stadium, served as the Olympic Stadium, staging the 
Opening and Closing Ceremonies and several of the competitions. There was 
no official Olympic Village.

the Olympic Games Athens 2004. Some are also open to 
visitors and host events such as concerts and conferences. 

An eighth venue was set up to host the Athens 1896 rowing 
competition, but this was cancelled due to stormy conditions. 
The venue is still in use.

Originally built in 329 BC, the stadium had fallen into disrepair in the 19th century before being restored 
for the 1896 Games. However, the work had not been completed by the time the Games began, and 
temporary wooden stands were installed.

The stadium has since hosted a number of sporting and cultural events, including the first Balkan Games 
in 1929, the opening ceremony of the 1997 IAAF World Championships, and the archery competitions 
and the finish of the men’s and women’s marathons at the Olympic Games Athens 2004.

Every two years, the stadium is also the venue for the official handover of the Olympic flame to the 
organisers of the next Olympic Summer or Winter Games. In April 2010, it opened to the public  
and became a visitor attraction, offering educational programmes for schools and tours. It is also  
a concert venue.

AT H E N S L AW N  T E N N I S C LU B
Founded in 1895 and the oldest tennis club in Greece, the Athens Lawn Tennis Club hosts local and 
international competitions, including Greece’s home Davis Cup matches. Open to members and  
visitors, it is also used for coaching and practice.

B AY O F  Z E A
The bay has been a harbour since the early fifth century BC. Some temporary facilities were erected for 
the Games, including a pier for spectators and shelters for boats. It is now a yacht marina with berthing 
capacity for 670 craft.

Z A P P E I O N
Opened in 1888 for the purposes of exhibiting Greek art and antiquities. The Athens 1896 fencing 
competition took place in the building’s circular atrium, around which spectator seating was installed. 
The venue has fulfilled a number of functions since then. A radio station and then a hospital during the 
Second World War, it was the home of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games Athens 2004 
from 1998 to 1999, and served as the main communications centre during the Games. Situated close 
to the Panathenaic Stadium, it is now a conference and exhibition centre and a member of the Historic 
Conference Centres of Europe association.

V E LO D R O M E
The 7,000-capacity velodrome at Neo Phaliron hosted the finish of the cycling road race and some of the 
tennis matches. Cycle races had been held before in the area, and the venue, which was refurbished to 
include other sporting facilities in 1899, would continue to stage them in the years immediately after the 
Games. The popularity of cycling began to decline in Greece, however, and the track was abandoned. In 
1925, the velodrome was converted into a football ground and the track removed. Eleven years later, the 
venue was renamed Karaiskakis Stadium. The home ground of the football club Olympiacos, it hosted 
several other sports as well. In 2003, it made way for a new Karaiskakis Stadium, which staged several 
football matches at the Olympic Games Athens 2004.

White marble was used to build the shooting stadium in the classical Greek style. The gallery featured 
long rows of columns and was capable of accommodating 30 shooters at a time. In 1922, the site was 
expropriated by the state to house refugees from the Greco-Turkish War, and the shooting range  
was relocated across the city of Athens to Kaisariani.

The men’s individual road race at Athens 1896 covered the same route as the marathon race, with riders 
racing from Athens to Marathon and back again. For the marathon race, competitors ran from Marathon 
to the Greek capital on a course that was only 24.8 miles long (modern-day marathons are run over a 
distance of 26.219 miles or 42.195 kilometres). The first Olympic marathon of the modern era, the race 
was held to commemorate the famous run that the messenger Pheidippides made in delivering news of 
the victory over the Persians in 490 BC. The Athens 1896 road race and marathon both finished at the 
Panathenaic Stadium, which is also the finish point for the Athens Classic Marathon, first held in 1972.

DID YOU K NOW?

The Panathenaic Stadium is so called because it was intended for use by all Athenians (the prefix - pan 
means “all, every, whole, all-inclusive”). It is also known as “Kallimarmaro”, Greek for “beautiful marble”.

In the Roman era, the stadium was a gladiator arena where wild animals were staged.

Along with the velodrome and the Kallithea stand, the stadium was one of three Athens 1896 
venues to provide temporary shelter for refugees from the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922.

The Athens 1896 marathon was won by Greek runner Spyridon Louis, who gave his name to  
the Olympic Stadium used at Athens 2004 and the Olympic Athletic Centre of Athens, where  
the Olympic Stadium is situated.

Fifteen competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Paris 1900, 
eight of which remain in use today. Eleven of the competition venues were 
existing, one was new and three were temporary, all of which have since been 
dismantled along with four of the existing venues. The one new venue is still in 
use, as are seven of the existing venues. Many of the remaining venues are 
home to sports clubs and provide recreational and sporting facilities for their 
members and visitors.

Four of the venues were later used at the Olympic Games Paris 1924: the 
Vélodrome de Vincennes, the Terrain de Polo de Bagatelle, the Palais de 
la Société des Régates du Havre, and the Cercle de la Voile de Paris.

No Opening or Closing Ceremonies were held at the Games, which ran for 
more than five months and were held as part of the 1900 Paris World’s Fair. In 
the absence of an Olympic Stadium, the main venue was the Vélodrome de 
Vincennes, which hosted six sports in all. There was no official Olympic Village.

Founded in 1886 and formerly one of five sites used by Racing Club de France, the Croix-Catelan is a 
large sports complex. It is home to 45 tennis courts, a 50m swimming pool, a gym, a football pitch and 
volleyball and basketball courts. The venue offers classes and lessons and several activities for children. 
Racing Club de France vacated the venue in 2006, when it was taken over by Lagardère Paris Racing.

rowing competition, which is held on the same section of the Seine as the Paris 1900 events. This section 
is also home to the Aviron Courbevoie club, which was founded in 1882. Paris Rowing Club relocated 
from Courbevoie in 1970, and rowing activities on the Seine are now mainly focused on areas such as

A venue for multiple competitions at Paris 1900, the velodrome opened in 1896 and also staged  
cycling events at the Olympic Games Paris 1924. The setting for the prestigious Grand Prix de Paris, 
the velodrome was also the official finish line of the Tour de France between 1968 and 1974 but suffered 
neglect thereafter and was closed in 1980. Thanks to a campaign to save it and three years  
of refurbishment work, it reopened to the public in 2015, with its original stands still intact. A listed 
historical monument, the venue is officially known as the Vélodrome Jacques Anquetil and more  
popularly as La Cipale.

The site was first used as a skating club in 1865. The Cercle du Bois de Boulogne came into being 
in 1899, at which point the venue became a clay pigeon shooting club, counting Pierre de Coubertin 
among its members. With the growth in popularity of tennis between the wars, the club began hosting 
tennis tournaments and became a popular practice venue for players competing in the French Open 
at Roland-Garros. The Ligue de Tennis de Paris is now the resident club. Among its many activities, it 
identifies and coaches talented young players.

The Société du Jeu de Pelote was founded in 1898 and built the French capital’s first permanent pelota 
court at 26 Rue Pauline Borghèse in Neuilly-sur-Seine. It was this court that hosted the competition held 
as part of the 1900 Olympic Games, with a small stand built next to it to accommodate spectators.

Two more courts were opened in Neuilly in the years immediately afterwards, as the popularity of the 
game spread, with new clubs being founded and the game finding its way into schools. This popularity 
quickly faded in the Neuilly area, however, leading to the closure of the Rue Pauline Borghèse court in 
1906. By 1912, Neuilly’s two other courts had also closed, while a fourth opened in 1913 only to shut 
down a year later.

This island in the Seine was a popular leisure destination and was used for recreational boating and

The facilities set up to host the equestrian jumping competition at Place de Breteuil were taken down

The great Belgian rider Eddy Merckx completed the last of his five Tour de France victories at the 
velodrome in 1974.

Built in 1902, Francis Field became the home of the Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) Bears 
American football team after the Games. In 1984, the stadium underwent its first major renovation, 
with the original cinder track replaced by a 400-metre artificial track. The seating capacity of its original 
reinforced concrete stands was also reduced to 4,000. The stadium was further refurbished in 2003  
and 2004, when an artificial pitch was installed. By this time, Francis Field was also home to the 
university’s women’s and men’s soccer, track and field, and cross-country teams.

Francis Field Stadium is the oldest Olympic stadium still in regular use for official sporting events  
and is also a registered historic landmark. In September 2018, a structure featuring the Olympic  
rings was erected nearby to provide a permanent reminder of the stadium’s Olympic status, a function 
also performed by the ornamental wrought-iron gate installed after the Games at the east entrance  
to the stadium. A year later, the venue was renamed Francis Olympic Field, to recognise its place in 
Olympic history.

C R E V E  C O EU R L A K E
One of the largest natural lakes in the state of Missouri, the venue has been the permanent base  
of the St. Louis Rowing Club since 1983, though the club has been racing on it intermittently since 
the early 1900s. A competitive racing club that also offers recreational rowing, it runs junior and adult 
programmes. The lake, which is also used by the community for recreational activities such as paddle 
boating and sailing, is part of the Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park, which is itself part of the St. Louis 
Urban Oases Important Bird Area.

Fourteen of the golf course’s holes are still laid out exactly as they were when it hosted the Olympic golf 
competition in 1904. Opened in 1901, Glen Echo Country Club was St. Louis’ first complete 18-hole 
golf course and organises competitions for women and men throughout the season. Its grounds and 
clubhouse also host weddings, galas and private social functions.

The venue was handed over to the WUSTL Department of Athletics after the Games. Since known as 
Francis Field House, it was converted into a modern, energy-efficient fitness, recreation and athletic 
centre in 2016. The building, which was also extended to incorporate new facilities, was renamed the 
Gary M. Sumers Recreation Centre.

During its renovation, parts of the original gymnasium were demolished. Some elements were retained, 
however. These include the gym’s original maple flooring, which was relaid in a bridge section connecting 
the existing and new parts of the facility. Among the centre’s many exercise spaces is the Olympic Studio, 
which celebrates the venue’s Olympic past and whose walls are lined with photographs from the 1904 
Games. The venue has also played a part in recent US political history, providing the setting for five 
presidential and vice-presidential debates since 1992.

The area that the courts once occupied is part of the campus of Washington University in St. Louis,

The venue was an oval-shaped man-made lake in St. Louis’ Forest Park and was created by 
the organisers of the 1904 World’s Fair to allow the US Coast Guard to demonstrate their life-
saving manoeuvres on the water. Modifications were made to the lake to create a course for the 
swimming events at the 1904 Games. These included the installation of a small pontoon dock  
from which competitors could dive into the water. The lake was emptied and refilled with soil after  
the Games. The site is now occupied by a golf course.

DID YOU K NOW?

Washington University in St. Louis built Francis Field Stadium for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 
which was held to celebrate the centenary of the USA’s purchase of the state from France. The event 
was held in conjunction with the 1904 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to take place in 
Chicago but were moved to St. Louis.

To commemorate the 1904 Olympic Games, the Olympic flame visited Francis Field during the torch

Fourteen competition venues were used for the Olympic Games London 
1908, eight of which remain in use today. Twelve of the competition venues 
were existing, one was new and one was temporary. The new venue has 
since been demolished, along with four of the existing ones. Most of the 
venues that remain in use are sports clubs, with several of them hosting 
major competitions and providing recreational and competitive sport for their 
members. 

The new venue was the London Olympic Stadium, where the Opening and 
Closing Ceremonies were held. Also known as White City Stadium, it was 
the main centre of the Games. It was regularly used for over 55 years before 
being demolished in 1984. There was no official Olympic Village. Only two of 
the venues were used again when London staged the 1948 Olympic Games: 
Henley Royal Regatta Course and Bisley Rifle Range.

The venue hosted the boxing competition at the 1908 Olympic Games. Built in the 1890s, it underwent 
reconstruction after being bombed during WWII, and it also survived a fire in 2001. Currently used for 
lectures, the hall is undergoing refurbishment, which will see it equipped with the latest technologies and 
a new lighting system. The university’s swimming pool was used as a training venue at the 1908 Games 
and is now a study area for students.

The club offers its members lawn tennis, real tennis, rackets and squash courts, and is the venue for the 
annual Queen’s Club Championships, the traditional curtain-raiser for Wimbledon. The club also stages 
the World Rackets Championships and the World Real Tennis Championship, and hosted the Super 
Series Squash Finals between 2009 and 2013.

It has hosted 25 different sports over the years, including ice skating, baseball, athletics and rugby,  
and was the venue for the annual Oxford v Cambridge rugby, football and athletics challenges up until  
the late 1920s.

Sailing remains a popular pursuit on Southampton Water, which is home to a number of sailing clubs. Ten 
of them are represented by the Southampton Water Sailing Association, which aims to promote sailing on 
this body of water and non-competitive racing between its member clubs.

The water motorsports races at the 1908 Olympic Games started from and ended at the Enchantress, 
the floating clubhouse of the Royal Motor Yacht Club, which was asked to organise the competition. 
Founded in 1905 and still in existence today, the club moved to Sandbanks, at Dorset’s Poole Harbour, in 
1936. The Enchantress was destroyed when it was hit by a bomb during WWI.

B I S L E Y R I F L E R A N G E
The venue for most of the shooting events is now known as the National Shooting Centre. Its famous 
Century range – so called because it comprises 100 targets – was converted for the Games. Bisley 
has been home to the National Rifle Association since 1890. The venue retains its original clubhouses 
and layout today, and its ranges remain largely similar. A new range – Cheylesmore – was laid out for 
the 1948 Olympic Games, and in more recent times Bisley hosted all the shooting events at the 2002 
Commonwealth Games.

Built for the 1908 Olympic Games, the multi-purpose 93,000-capacity stadium formed part of the site 
chosen to stage the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition. In an effort to host as many events as possible at the 
stadium, the Organising Committee constructed a swimming pool and diving tower, a banked cycle track 
around the athletics track, and a pitch on the infield for football, hockey, rugby and lacrosse matches. The 
swimming pool and tower were dismantled after the Games, when the venue became known as White 
City Stadium.

The stadium was used sporadically in the years immediately after the Games, but began staging 
greyhound races in 1927. It continued to do so up until its demolition in 1984. It was also a venue for 
rugby, American football, boxing, speedway, football and athletics. Queens Park Rangers FC used it as 
their home ground for brief periods in the 1930s and 1960s, while the British Amateur Athletic Association 
Championships were held there from 1932 to 1971. In 1934, the stadium hosted the British Empire 
Games (the forerunner of the Commonwealth Games), and it was also the venue for the match between 
France and Uruguay at the 1966 football World Cup.

Following the stadium’s demolition, the site was occupied by administrative and commercial buildings. 
Westfield London shopping centre also occupies part of the White City site.

The rink opened on London’s Montpelier Square in November 1896. A year after hosting the figure 
skating events at London 1908, it staged the Women’s Exhibition, held in support of women’s suffrage. 
The rink closed in 1917. The building was used by the Daimler Motor Company before being demolished 
in the mid-1970s. The site is now occupied by a private garden.

The venue for the trap shooting events at the 1908 Olympic Games. The club, which was located in 
countryside at the time, hosted the British Clay Pigeon Association’s championship a week after the 
Games. It was demolished in 1932. The site, which lies in the London suburb of Wembley, is now  
covered by housing.

A large tent was erected just outside White City Stadium to host some of the fencing events. It was taken 
down after the Games.

DID YOU K NOW?

The swimming pool at the Olympic Stadium was 100m in length and encased in concrete. The water was 
untreated and became murky, causing competitors to bump into each other on occasion. Parts of the 
swimming pool were discovered when the foundations of the BBC’s White City building were dug.

White City’s Olympic past is still remembered. The London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay passed through 
the area on the day before the Opening Ceremony. A plaque listing the medallists from the 1908 Games 
was unveiled in one of the current White City buildings in 2005, while another nearby plaque reads,  
“This is the site of the finishing line of White City Stadium which hosted the 1908 Olympics.”

The Olympic Stadium also hosted the finish of the marathon. The race began at Windsor Castle and  
the course distance of 26 miles and 385 yards (42.195 kilometres) was adopted as the standard for the 
event from that point on.

Listed as a national heritage site and originally intended as a temporary wooden structure, this red-brick 
venue was built in the neoclassical style. It is still used regularly today and has been refurbished on 
several occasions. 

It now stages sporting events such as the Diamond League and the Stockholm Marathon, as well as 
major concerts. The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and AC/DC are just some of the acts to have 
performed at the venue. The venue for the city’s Olympic Jubilee celebrations in 2012, it is also used for 
cross-country skiing in the winter months, when three 430-metre tracks are laid out.

The stadium was also a stand-in venue at the Olympic Games Melbourne / Stockholm 1956, staging 
some of the equestrian events, which had to be held outside Australia due to the country’s strict 
quarantine laws for horses.

in 1880, it is one of Sweden’s oldest rowing clubs and offers a wide range of boats – from singles to 
eights – for rowers of all abilities. The club’s main boathouse was erected in 1913 using wooden planks 
and seating from the temporary spectator stand constructed for the previous year’s Olympic rowing 
events. Some of the seat numbers can be seen on the ceiling of this culturally significant building, which 
remains largely unchanged. The club opened a second boathouse in 2004.

The Stockholm 1912 marathon took place on an out-and-back course, which ran northwards from the 
Olympic Stadium to the small town of Sollentuna and back to the stadium again. In 1913, a monument 
was erected at the course’s turning point in Sollentuna, just beyond the town’s main church.

Positioned exactly 20.1 kilometres from the start line in the stadium, the monument is a seven metre-
tall Doric column and was designed by the same architect who constructed the Stockholm Olympic 
Stadium. The front of the stone atop the column bears a cross with the date “1912”. On the back is 
inscribed the Swedish word “Vändpunkten”, meaning “The Turn”. The monument was the halfway mark  
of the 2012 Jubilee Marathon, which was held to celebrate the centenary of the Olympic race.

DID YOU K NOW?

When the Olympic Stadium was built, large granite blocks were left at the main entrance to allow local 
artists to express themselves. Two sculptures were completed in time for the Games. Located beneath 
the clock on the eastern tower, they depict Ask and Embla, the first human beings created by the gods  
of Nordic mythology.

A lottery was created specifically to finance the construction of the Olympic Stadium.

The marathon monument in Sollentuna was donated to the town by the director of the stone  
company that made it.

Prior to the 1920 Olympic Games, the site was used by Beerschot Athletic Club for training.  
The stadium project included the construction of a new grandstand, the enlarging of existing 
grandstands, the extension of the track and the building of an access road. At Games time, the  
stadium had a capacity of 35,000. 

Following the Games, further work was carried out to convert the stadium into a football ground for 
the club K Beerschot VA. In 2000, the venue underwent a major refurbishment. The running track was 
removed, four separate stands were created, and the capacity was reduced to 13,000. The club still 
plays its home games at the stadium, though no other major events have taken place there since the 
1920 Olympic Games.

R OYA L B E E R SC H OT T E N N I S A N D  H O C K E Y C LU B
Built in 1899 and situated next to the Olympic Stadium, the club had 14 clay courts at Games time. 
Now home to nine outdoor and seven indoor courts, the club, which has been renamed Tennis 7 de 
Olympiade, is open for use by local residents and stages regional and national tennis competitions 
throughout the year, among them the City of Antwerp Tournament. A multi-sport venue, the club also 
offers field hockey, swimming and pétanque.

B U I T E N - IJ
Located in Amsterdam, north-east of the city centre, this body of water staged the 12-foot dinghy 
competition at the 1920 Olympic Games. It was also used as a sailing venue at the Olympic Games 
Amsterdam 1928, when it hosted the single-handed Olympic monotype class. The area is now part of 
the port of Amsterdam, the fourth busiest in Europe.

Part of Antwerp Zoo, which opened in 1844, the hall was the venue for the boxing and wrestling 
competitions. Welcoming more than a million visitors a year, the zoo is home to one of the world’s most 
advanced animal research centres.

W I L L E B R O E K  CA N A L
Though mainly used for transporting goods and flood management, the canal has hosted rowing events 
since the Games and is used by the Royal Sport Nautique de Bruxelles (RSNB) for recreational rowing 
and training, and competitions such as the Brussels Winter Rowing Regatta. It is not clear what facilities 
were built for the rowing competitions, but they are believed to have been temporary.

B E V E R LO O CA M P
The camp played host to the shooting events in 1920. It opened in 1839 and became a permanent 
military base in 1845 – a status it retains to this day. Occupied by German troops in both world wars, it 
was used as a prisoner-of-war camp and partly damaged by an Allied bombardment in 1944. In 1976, the 
barracks were modernised, and hundreds of houses were built for the families of the personnel stationed 
there. It is Belgium’s largest garrison.

This was the venue for the very first Olympic ice hockey competition and only the second figure skating 
competition, after London 1908. The Ice Palace opened in 1910 as a roller-skating rink before being converted 
into an ice rink the year before the Games. Later used as a garage and a taxi depot, it was dismantled in 2016.

V É LO D R O M E D’A N V E R S  Z U R E N B O R G
The venue opened in June 1914 and had a 400m concrete track. It was located in a park in the Wilrijk 
district. As well as the four Olympic track cycling events, it also staged the 1920 World Championships 
and the end of a stage of the Tour de Belgique. The infield was used as a football pitch after the Games. 
The velodrome was demolished in 1925 to make way for housing.

J U L ES  OT T E N STA D I U M
The venue for the first-round match between Italy and Egypt at the 1920 Olympic football tournament, 
the stadium was the home ground of football club KAA Gent for 93 years. It was refurbished on several 
occasions, with new stands being built in 1986, 1992 and 2002. When the club moved to a new stadium 
in 2013, their old home was demolished. A housing development now stands on the site.

B R O O DST R A AT  STA D I O N
The stadium opened in 1908 and staged two matches at the 1920 Olympic football tournament.  
It was the home ground of Royal Antwerp FC until 1923, when the club moved out because it was too 
small to accommodate their growing fan base. The stadium no longer exists, though the date of its 
demolition is not known.

T E M P O R A RY V E N U ES

M E R S K E M -A N T W E R P
The individual and team time trials were held on the same 175-kilometre course. Riders left at four-minute 
intervals from the Antwerp district of Merksem and rode on to Turnhout, Mol, Heist-op-den-Berg and Lier 
before returning to the city. The first cross-country stage of the three-day eventing competition (a 50km 
race), which took place mostly on roads, also finished near Merskem, though the exact location of the 
finish line is not known.

A N T W E R P  WAT E R S P O RTS STA D I U M
The venue comprised three parallel pools overlooked at one end by a clubhouse. A 50-metre swimming 
course with seven starting positions was laid out in the main pool, while the middle pool was reserved for 
the water polo matches. The stadium was dismantled after the Games.

DID YOU K NOW?

Belgium’s King Albert I monitored preparations for the Olympic Games very closely. On 27 March
1920, he paid a visit to the Olympic Stadium to see how work was progressing. To avoid being
recognised, he wore a disguise.

One of Belgium’s oldest navigable canals, Willebroek Canal runs for 28 kilometres and links Brussels
with the Scheldt River. 

The water at the Antwerp Water Sports Stadium was so cold – due to unseasonably cool temperatures – 
that competitors sprinted to warm showers after their races.

All but four of the venues are/were in the Paris area. The Stade Olympique de 
Colombes hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and several of the 
competitions. The official Olympic Village, a temporary facility, was the first of its

The home of jump racing in France, this 40,000-capacity racecourse opened on 1 November 1873 
and occupies a 33-hectare site on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne. It is home to a hurdles track, 
two steeplechase tracks and a figure-of-eight track, which together offer 25 different routes. One of its 
steeplechase tracks was used at the 1924 Olympic Games, as were the racecourse grounds.
New stone stands were built that year, while the tracks were improved and the facilities upgraded 
between 1967 and 1975.

Auteuil is the venue for all of France’s nine Group 1 hurdle and steeplechase races. The highlights of the 
racecourse’s calendar include International Jump Weekend in November and the Grand Steeple-
Chase de Paris in June. In 2020, it staged 222 races.

C E R C L E D E L A VO I L E D E PA R I S
The club was founded in 1858 and its clubhouse still stands to this day. Also a sailing venue at Paris 
1900, it organises regattas across a number of classes.

The subject of a famous painting by Claude Monet, the Bassin d’Argenteuil lies close to the Stade 
Olympique de Colombes. Though the construction of the Genevilliers river port has led to an increase in 
traffic on this stretch of the River Seine, it is still used for rowing today, in particular by the COM Argenteuil 
club, which was founded in 1965.

Work had begun on the construction of a swimming pool next to the Stade Olympique de Colombes 
when, in December 1922, the City of Paris proposed the construction of an aquatic sports centre in the 
north of Paris to host the swimming and diving competitions at the 1924 Olympic Games. The swimming 
pool was renamed the Piscine Georges Vallerey after the Games and renovated in 1989. It now has a 
retractable roof and is still used by clubs for competitions and by Parisians for recreational swimming and 
other aquatic sports. It is also home to the national swimming federation.

This was the venue for the 50km, sprint, tandem and team pursuit track cycling events at the 1924 
Olympic Games. The velodrome opened in 1896 and staged multiple competitions at the Olympic 
Games Paris 1900 (cycling, football, gymnastics, rugby, cricket and archery). The setting for the 
prestigious Grand Prix de Paris, it was also the official finish line of the Tour de France between 1968 and 
1974 but suffered neglect thereafter and was closed in 1980. Thanks to a campaign to save it and three 
years of refurbishment work, it reopened to the public in 2015, with its original stands still intact. A listed 
historical monument, the venue is officially known as the Vélodrome Jacques Anquetil and more popularly 
as
 La Cipale.

A multi-sports venue at the 1924 Olympic Games, it continued to host a variety of sports afterwards. The 
venue for the 1938 football World Cup final, it also staged the European Athletics Championships that 
year and was Paris’ premier sports venue until the construction of the Parc des Princes in the early 1970s. 
Prior to that, the Stade Olympique de Colombes hosted 42 French Cup finals in football and 79 national 
team matches. It was also a major rugby venue, welcoming the French national team on 87 occasions 
– the last time in 1972 – and being used by Top 14 team Racing 92 as its home ground until 2017. Now 
known as Stade Yves-du-Manoir, it is being refurbished for the Olympic Games Paris 2024, when it will 
be used for the field hockey competitions.

Refurbished in 2000 and now a 22,500-capacity multi-use venue, the Olympic Stadium was the venue 
for the 2016 European Athletics Championships and hosts concerts and other sporting events, such 
as the annual Amsterdam Marathon (start and finish) and Olympic Moves, the largest secondary school 
sports competition in the Netherlands. The venue attracts around 1.4 million visitors a year and will 
host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2023 World Gymnaestrada, a non-competition event 
organised by the International Gymnastics Federation. Over 30 companies and organisations have their 
offices at the stadium, including the Johan Cruyff Foundation.

Built for the Games, the stadium was designed to host a number of different events, including football, 
athletics and cycling. It was regularly used as a football venue after the Games, staging the 1962 
European Cup Final between Benfica and Real Madrid and, between 1934 and 1996, European
club competition ties involving AFC Ajax. When the city council drew up plans for the stadium’s
demolition in the late 1980s, a campaign was organised to save it and ultimately led to it being listed
as a national monument.

Some of the roads were repaired and marked out in preparation for the race. A map is available on p. 164 
of the Official Report.

A straight course measuring 3,000 metres long was marked out on this waterway, situated in south-west 
Amsterdam. The canal was so narrow, however, that it was able to accommodate only two boats at a 
time, which meant more preliminary races had to be held than is usually the case. It continues to form part 
of the Dutch capital’s extensive network of canals.

Located north-east of the city centre, and the second body of water used for sailing competitions at the 
Olympic Games Amsterdam 1928, it hosted the single-handed Olympic monotype class. It also staged 
the 12-foot dinghy competition at the Olympic Games Antwerp 1920. The area is now part of the port of 
Amsterdam, the fourth busiest in Europe.

M U N I C I PA L S P O RTS  PA R K ,  H I LV E R S U M
Built in 1919, it was used as an equestrian and modern pentathlon venue at Amsterdam 1928. The 
stadium’s monumental grandstand has been fully refurbished twice since then – most recently in 2010 
– though the trotting track and director’s building have both been dismantled. The stadium is used by 
a local athletics club, local schools for PE lessons, and the sports retailer Nike, which has its European 
headquarters close by.

O L D  STA D I U M
Built in 1912, the Old Stadium was the Netherlands’ first sports stadium. Prior to the construction of the 
Olympic Stadium for the 1928 Games, it was also the main sports facility in the country and the capital, 
hosting more than 25 of the Dutch national football team’s home matches. It was also the venue for Dutch 
domestic cup finals. Following its replacement by the Olympic Stadium, it was demolished in 1929 to 
make way for the Zuid-Oost housing project.

Z E E B U R G R I F L E R A N G E
The Official Report of the Olympic Games Amsterdam 1928 states that an “improvised” pistol range 
was set up at the venue’s machine gun range to host the shooting round of the modern pentathlon 
competition only (shooting was not on the programme at Amsterdam 1928). The range is no longer  
in existence.

A M E R S F O O RT
Though the Official Report of the Olympic Games Amsterdam 1928 does not state the exact venue  
of the modern pentathlon equestrian event, the horses were stabled at what was known as the Riding 
House. Amersfoort, which is 52km south-east of Amsterdam, is now home to a number of riding schools 
and academies.

Z U I D E R Z E E
One of two sailing venues used at Amsterdam 1928, it hosted the two largest boat classes. Shortly after 
the Games, a dam was built across the Zuiderzee to separate it into the outer Waddenzee, which is open 
to the North Sea, and the inner Ijsselmeer, a freshwater lake named after the river that empties into it.

This was one of two semi-permanent constructions (the other being the Fencing Pavilion) built next to the 
Olympic Stadium as part of the Olympic Stadium Complex, of which the temporary Olympic Sports Park 
Swim Stadium was also a part. The iron-framed pavilion, which had a capacity of approximately 4,500

a number of different businesses.

With a view to keeping costs low, the stadium was designed to be used for a few weeks only. The pool 
itself was made of reinforced concrete and measured 50 metres long and 18 metres wide. Stands were 
erected on both sides and accommodated several thousand spectators. The stadium was dismantled, 
as planned, immediately after the Games.

DID YOU K NOW?

For the first time in the modern era, the Olympic flame was lit at Amsterdam 1928. It burned for the  
duration of the Games in a cauldron at the top of the Olympic Stadium’s Marathon Tower – the start
of a tradition that has continued ever since.

The original Marathon Tower still stands today. At 42.19 metres tall, it is exactly the same height in 
 metres as the distance of a marathon in kilometres.

The Olympic Stadium was built in the Amsterdam School style, as was the Municipal Sports Park in 
Hilversum. The style is characterised by the use of brick for structure and design, rounded elements
and decorative masonry, among other features.

The streets and areas around the Olympic Stadium have sport- and Olympic-themed names:
Olympiaplein (Olympic Square), Marathonstraat (Marathon Street), Olympiaweg (Olympic Way),
Discusstraat (Discus Street) and Sportstraat (Sport Street) among them. Beyond lie other streets
named after Greek deities and mythological figures such as Artemis, Aphrodite, Eos and Heracles.

The stadium was built in 1921 on the site of an abandoned racecourse at the city’s Exposition Park and 
had a Games-time capacity of 105,000. It is also known as Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, in honour of 
local World War One veterans.

The stadium has since been used for sporting events, concerts, religious gatherings and political rallies, 
and again hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and track and field events when the city staged 
the Olympic Games for a second time in 1984. It will do so again when the Games return to Los Angeles 
in 2028. 

The University of Southern California’s sports teams have used the venue since 1932, among them the 
Trojans, its American football team. The stadium has provided the setting for two Super Bowls, several 
World Series baseball matches, and four US Olympic track and field trials. The Los Angeles Rams, Los 
Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Dodgers are just some of the many sports teams that have called the 
stadium home at some time or other in its history.

Figures such as John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and Billy Graham have all 
addressed large crowds at the Los Angeles Olympic Stadium, which has also played host to the Rolling

major refurbishment in 2019.

The stadium was built in 1925. The lagoon was dredged in preparation for the rowing competitions. 
After the Games, the marina was offered to the City of Long Beach and is still used as a training and 
competition venue by the USA’s Olympic rowing team, Long Beach Rowing Association, the California 
State University Long Beach rowing team, and junior rowing programmes. It is also the home of the 
Southern California Speedboat Club, which stages races there, including the annual Long Beach Sprint 
Nationals.

A permanent facility, it was built next to the Olympic Stadium. The venue’s 5,000-capacity wooden 
grandstand was dismantled after the Games, and the pool was opened to the public. The building 
suffered from a lack of maintenance thereafter and was closed following an earthquake in 1994. It was 
renovated in 2003, when a new recreation complex was built nearby, with its original facade preserved. 
The venue now offers swim classes, entry-level programmes for juniors, junior lifeguard camps, and 
recreational swimming for people of all ages, as well as artistic swimming and water polo.

R OS E B OW L  STA D I U M 
The Rose Bowl was temporarily adapted to host the cycling events at the Games, with the track 
dismantled immediately afterwards. It is a prestigious venue in US sport and synonymous with American 
football. The setting for the annual Rose Bowl Game since 1923, it has staged five Super Bowl matches 
and is the home of the UCLA Bruins. It is also well known as a soccer stadium, hosting matches at the 
Olympic Games in 1984, the 1994 World Cup and 1999 Women’s World Cup, including the finals of both 
FIFA tournaments. The venue will also stage sports events at the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028.

Used by the National Guard, the Los Angeles State Armory was temporarily adapted to host the fencing 
competitions and restored to its original condition afterwards. It had a Games-time capacity of 1,800.

Science Learning and Innovation, an annex of the California Science Center, in 2004.

Built in 1924 as a boxing venue, it was adapted for the Games, after which it became the city’s largest 
and most popular entertainment centre. A multi-purpose venue, it has also served as a roller derby rink, 
a wrestling hall, a concert venue and a location for films such as The Manchurian Candidate, Rocky and 
Raging Bull. The venue was sold in 2005 and is now a church.

The home of the Los Angeles Police Revolver and Athletic Club, the venue was refurbished for the
Games. A training site for the city’s police officers, it has also been used as a location in many TV

It was dismantled, transported to the range and reassembled. It was later used as the range’s 
restaurant and café.

The exact location of the course and facilities used for the equestrian events is not known. The club

Built in a matter of months, the Village had a postal and telegraph service, an amphitheatre, a laundrette, 
a restaurant, a hospital, a dental clinic, baths, a fire department, a radio station and a bank. Only male 
athletes stayed at the Olympic Village, housed in temporary wooden cottages. Their female counterparts 
were put up at a private hotel in Los Angeles. Most of the complex, which became a model for future 
Organising Committees to follow, was dismantled after the Games. The remaining housing is still 
occupied by local residents today.

DID YOU K NOW?

The architecture of the Los Angeles Olympic Stadium incorporates elements of the Egyptian, Spanish 
and Mediterranean Revival styles. One of the stadium’s most distinctive features is its grand peristyle, 
situated at its eastern end. 

Long Beach Marine Stadium was the first manmade rowing course in the USA and is now registered 
as a California Historical Landmark site.

Produced by Stephen DeBro, the 2016 documentary 18th & Grand tells the colourful story of
 the Olympic Auditorium.

As the organisers of the next Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936, Germany’s National Olympic Committee 
bought some of the Olympic Village’s cottages, as did Japanese officials, in preparation for the 1940 
Games in Tokyo, which were cancelled because of WWII.

Built between 1934 and 1936, this neoclassical-style stadium was sited on the foundations of the 
Deutsche Stadion, originally constructed for the 1916 Olympic Games, which were cancelled due 
to the outbreak of WWI. The stadium forms part of Berlin Olympic Park, which was known as the 
Reichssportfeld at Games time and is also home to the May Field, the Hockey Stadium, the Tennis 
Courts and Tennis Stadium, the Swimming Stadium and the Waldbühne.

Occupied by British troops at the end of WWII, the stadium was returned to the local authorities in 1949. 
In 1966, it was listed as a historical monument. The stadium then underwent a number of modifications 
and renovations, the most extensive coming in the early 2000s, in preparation for the 2006 football World 
Cup, when the lower ring was rebuilt and two rows of seats and a roof were added. 

Used mostly as a football venue since the war, it has been the home stadium of Hertha BSC since 1963.
Berlin Olympic Stadium has hosted the German Cup Final since 1985. A venue at the 1974 World Cup, 
it also staged the final of the 2006 World Cup and the opening match of the 2011 Women’s World Cup. 
Also a major track and field venue, it staged the 2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and the 
2018 European Athletics Championships. Several major acts have performed at the venue, among them 
Madonna, Depeche Mode and Coldplay. 

G R Ü N AU  R EG AT TA  C O U R S E
A grandstand for 9,000 spectators was built alongside the existing 2,000-metre, six-lane regatta course 
on the Langer See in the Grünau district of Berlin. The venue is still used today, serving as a national 
training centre for rowing and canoeing. It is also a development centre for various water sports and is 
used for both high-performance and recreational sport. 

B E R L I N O LY M PI C SW I M M I N G STA D I U M
Listed as a historical building, the stadium is still in use and retains its original 50-metre pool and diving 
pool. Directly connected to the Olympic Stadium by a tunnel, this open-air swimming stadium had two 
grandstands with a capacity of 17,000. Such was the advance interest in the Olympic swimming, diving 
and water polo competitions that a third stand was built at one end of the stadium. It was removed after 
the Games, since when the stadium has undergone a series of modernisations and structural changes. 
The most comprehensive of them was carried out for the 1978 FINA World Swimming Championships, 
when the capacity of the grandstands was reduced to 7,500.

This public road was also used as a motor racing circuit. Today, it forms the northern part of 
Bundesautobahn 115. Some of the stands erected for the road cycling event are protected buildings.

Adjoining Berlin Olympic Stadium, the hockey stadium’s capacity was increased to 18,000 for the Games 
with the addition of temporary stands. The stadium remained in use after the Games but was destroyed 
at the end of WWII. Rebuilt in 1954, it is home to several Berlin hockey clubs and is used by local schools 
and the German national team for training. Its capacity has now been reduced to 10,800.

Located in the Olympic Park, the venue had space for 20,000 in its 85 rows of seating. Destroyed during 
WWII, the stage was rebuilt in 1961. The first Olympic venue to be used solely for gymnastics at Games 
time, it was later renamed the Waldbühne and repurposed to host cultural events such as an annual 
concert given by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. It has also staged boxing matches and an infamous 
1965 concert by the Rolling Stones, which ended in a riot that caused extensive damage to the venue. It 
was not used again until its renovation seven years later. 

Modelled on an Ancient Greek amphitheatre, the Waldbühne has a roofed stage and lighting for evening 
performances. One of the most popular open-air theatres in the world, it was ranked Europe’s best 
amphitheatre in 2019 by a respected concert-industry magazine.

Covering an area of 112,000 square metres and created as an open space for gymnastics and athletics 
demonstrations, the May Field staged the individual and team dressage competitions. Temporary 
equestrian infrastructure was installed for the Games. The venue is part of Berlin Olympic Park and is 
located next to the Olympic Stadium. From the end of WWII until 1994, the May Field was part of the 
British sector in West Berlin, and was used for rugby, football and polo, among other sports, and staged 
public events . It is now used by a number of sports clubs, including Berlin Cricket Club, and also hosts a 
music festival and a fireworks championship.

The sailing events at the 1936 Olympic Games were held in Kiel Bay, to the north of the city of Kiel. Now 
known as Sporthafen Düsternbrook, It is still a popular sailing venue today and is home to the Kiel Yacht 
Club for sailing, which has 300 moorings and offers training for youngsters and competitive sailing for its 
members.

The building known as the ‘Olympic home’, which accommodated sailing athletes, was partially 
destroyed during WWII and rebuilt. It currently hosts the Kiel Institute of World Economics.

The Olympic Village was built on an unused site in Elstal, 14 kilometres west of Berlin. It accommodated 
most of the 4,000 male athletes during the Games. Its 140 houses were organised in a half-circle around 
a communal building and dining hall known as the House of Nations. It also featured administrative and 
technical buildings, 38 smaller dining halls, a sauna, a post office, a bank, a medical centre, a restaurant 
open to the public, shops and a laundrette.

After WWII, the Village was used as accommodation for Russian and Soviet soldiers and their families, 
though the only buildings that remained by that time were the House of Nations, the sports and swim 
halls, and the halls that had housed the Swiss, Turkish and US athletes. When the Cold War ended, the 
site was abandoned and vandalised. A fire destroyed the swim hall in 1993, at which point the Village was 
listed as a protected heritage site. 

Some of the buildings were later renovated and opened to the public. In 2017, work began on the 
renovation of the House of Nations and its conversion into 117 rental apartments to alleviate a housing 
shortage in Berlin. These apartments have already been sold. The construction of an additional 300 
housing units in 20 terraced houses and apartment buildings is also planned.

Some athletes were housed elsewhere, at newly built army barracks in Döberitz. The barracks have since 
been renovated and are now apartment blocks. Three facilities in Köpenick accommodated the athletes 
taking part in the rowing and canoeing competitions: Köpenick Palace, Köpenick Police Officers’ School 
and Dorotheen School. All three still stand today. The near-350 female participants who took part in the 
Games stayed at a student hall of residence called Frisian House, close to the Olympic Stadium. The 
building is now home to the administrative offices of Hertha BSC, who play in Germany’s Bundesliga.

The venue had a capacity of 20,000. It was extensively damaged during an Allied air raid in 1943.
Rebuilt after the war, it became a multi-purpose sports arena used for sports such as ice hockey,
football and boxing. The subject of several closures for repairs, it was finally demolished in 2011, 
and a conference centre was built on the site.

The roof of Berlin Olympic Stadium weighs 3,500 tonnes and is covered by a translucent membrane 
made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), with glass around the edge. It also features lighting and sound 
systems.

At the request of FINA, ropes were used to mark the lanes at the Swimming Stadium. Chlorine was added 
to the water to prevent it from going murky and to allow swimmers to see where they were going.
Air traffic was banned over the Olympic Games venues. The only craft that was allowed to fly over the 
Olympic Stadium on the day of the Opening Ceremony was the LZ-129 Hindenburg, one of the biggest 
airships ever built. 

The Olympic Stadium was awarded the IPC/IAKS Distinction for Accessibility in 2007 in recognition of its 
functionality for people with disabilities.

Twenty-nine competition venues were used for the Olympic Games 
London 1948, 19 of which remain in use to cater for high-performance and 
grassroots/community sport. Aside from one temporary venue, all the other 
competition venues were existing. No Olympic Village was built either, out 
of a desire to keep costs low in a country still recovering from WWII. Of the 
nine venues no longer in use, five are football stadiums. The temporary 
venue was dismantled after the Games.

Empire Stadium, now Wembley Stadium, hosted the Opening and Closing 
Ceremonies and the athletics competitions. Two of the venues had been 
used at the 1908 Olympic Games (Henley Royal Regatta Course and 
Bisley Rifle Range), while three were used at London 2012: Empire Stadium
(Wembley), Empire Pool (Wembley Arena) and Empress Hall (Earl’s Court).

Built for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924/25, the stadium hosted its first FA Cup final in 1923 and 
remains the venue for this showpiece match and for the League Cup final today. It is also the home of 
England’s national football team and staged the 1966 World Cup final, the finals of the 1996 and 2020 
UEFA European Championships, and the finals of the London 2012 women’s and men’s Olympic  
football tournaments.

The stadium has on occasion provided London football clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur with a 
temporary home, and it has been used for several other sports over the years, including rugby league, 
rugby union, American football, speedway, boxing and baseball. It is also a celebrated concert venue  
and was the setting for the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. It also hosts corporate events and offers  
guided tours for visitors.

One of the two physical remnants of the 1948 Olympic Games is Olympic Way, since renamed  
Wembley Way. A half-mile approach to the stadium leading from the nearest London Underground 
station, it was built for the Games and channels spectators in their thousands to the stadium’s gates.  
The other is the Olympic Roll of Honour, two large plaques commemorating the gold medallists at the 
1948 Olympic Games and set in the walls on either side of the Royal Tunnel. The plaques were removed 
and kept safe when the stadium was demolished in 2003 and returned to Wembley in time for the  
2012 Olympic Games, as part of an exhibition at the new stadium.

LYO N S  S P O RTS  G R O U N D,  S U D B U RY H I L L
Created in memory of the soldiers who died in WWI, it opened in 1919. The site was sold in 2000  
and, though the original pitches remain, the pavilions have been replaced by an indoor tennis and  
fitness centre.

It is now used by the University of Westminster’s sports teams. The stadium grandstand was built in 1936 
and is now a listed building. The stadium was originally home to the Polytechnic Harriers Athletics Club 
and other local clubs and schools, and it was a venue for training at the 1948 Olympic Games and for 
competitions such as the Amateur Athletic Association Championships.

H E R N E H I L L V E LO D R O M E
The velodrome continues to be used as a community cycling venue, 130 years on from its construction. 
Available for corporate events and private functions, it is used regularly by local clubs and 15 local schools 
and is also open to disability groups. 

The oldest remaining venue from the Olympic Games London 1948, it is one of the most famous 
velodromes in the UK and is widely regarded as the spiritual home of British cycling. It enjoyed its heyday 
in the 1920s and 30s, when events such as the Good Friday Meeting attracted crowds of up to 12,000. 
Though in regular use after the 1948 Olympic Games, it was threatened with closure in 2010 due to the 
poor state of the facilities. The velodrome was extensively refurbished between 2011 and 2017, when 
the 450m banked asphalt track received a completely new surface, floodlights were installed, and a 
new pavilion was built to accommodate new changing rooms, offices, a café and bike storage facilities. 
It was London’s only velodrome until the construction of Lee Valley VeloPark for the 2012 Olympic Games.

E M P I R E P O O L
Empire Pool was part of the Wembley Park complex, the main hub at the 1948 Olympic Games. 
Used at the 1934 Empire Games, (as the Commonwealth Games were formerly known), it hosted its 
last swimming events at London 1948. It has since become a prominent music and sporting venue, 
welcoming boxing, ice skating and basketball, among other sports, and providing the setting for the 
Horse of the Year show until 2002. Awarded listed status in 1976, it was renamed Wembley Arena  
two years later. The venue staged the badminton and rhythmic gymnastics competitions at the  
2012 Olympic Games.

T W ES E L D OW N R AC EC O U R S E
A horse racing venue since 1866, it staged National Hunt meetings until 1932. An equestrian venue  
at the 1948 Olympic Games, it continues to host national eventing horse trials and is also used for  
training and riding clinics.

H E N L E Y R OYA L  R EG AT TA  C O U R S E
Held in the Oxfordshire town of Henley-on-Thames, the regatta first took place in 1839 and has been 
staged every year since, with the exception of the two world wars and 2020, when it was cancelled due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has made use of four courses to date. The Olympic rowing competitions in 
1948 were held on the fourth of these: the Straight Course. The venue hosted four men’s rowing events at 
the 1908 Olympic Games, on a different course.

LO N D O N 194 8’S F O OT B A L L G R O U N DS
Ten football grounds were used at the 1948 Olympic Games. Five remain in use: Selhurst Park (the home 
of Crystal Palace), Craven Cottage (Fulham), Fratton Park (Portsmouth), White Hart Lane (Tottenham 
Hotspur, rebuilt and renamed in 2019) and Champion Hill (non-league team Dulwich Hamlet, though the 
original stadium was knocked down and a new, smaller stadium was built on the same site in 1992).

The remaining five are no longer in existence. Most of these not-in-use stadiums have made way for 
residential developments. At Highbury, for example, the listed East and West stands remain as flats,
with their original facades having been refurbished. The site of the Goldstone Ground is now occupied  
by the Goldstone Retail Park.

When it opened, the Palace of Engineering was the world’s largest reinforced concrete structure.

Now known as Töölö Sports Hall, the venue is used extensively by the local community and offers a 
wide variety of sports, including badminton, table tennis, fencing and self-defence sports. It also stages 
basketball and volleyball matches and fencing, boxing and gymnastics competitions.

The stadium opened in June 1938, having originally been built for the cancelled 1940 Olympic Games. 
A Helsinki landmark, it is home to the Sports Museum of Finland and is Finland’s largest outdoor arena. It 
has staged the IAAF World Athletics Championships twice and the European Athletics Championships 
three times. The venue for the final of the UEFA Women’s Euro 2009, the stadium is also the home ground 
of the Finnish national men’s and women’s football teams and Helsinki club HJK. It plays host to the 
country’s cup finals and will be the venue for the 2022 UEFA Super Cup.

A multi-purpose facility, it has hosted more than 20 sports over the years. In winter months, the pitch 
is converted into an ice rink for use by the community, and various winter sports are played there. 
Throughout the year, the stadium is used extensively for community and school events such as carnivals, 
youth fun runs and snow festivals, and welcomes around 600,000 visitors a year. A number of major 
international pop and rock groups and acts have performed there. 

In 2019, the stadium underwent an extensive refurbishment and was fitted out with artist and athlete 
lounges, stakeholder and media spaces, a new visitors’ centre, a restaurant, multi-functional conference 
rooms, and new VIP and corporate boxes. Safety improvements were also made.

SW I M M I N G STA D I U M
The venue is situated close to the Olympic Stadium. Construction began in 1939, in preparation for the 
cancelled 1940 Olympic Games. Work on the stadium resumed in 1947 and it was completed in time 
for the Games. Finland’s first outdoor aquatics complex, the Helsinki Municipal Swimming Stadium is 
open to the public from May through to September. Though the venue is no longer used for international 
competitions, it is popular with the public. Its facilities include a 50-metre pool, a diving pool, a children’s 
pool, a weightlifting area, two beach volleyball courts and a basketball court. The stadium underwent 
extensive refurbishment in 2013.

V E LO D R O M E
Another venue intended for use at the cancelled 1940 Olympic Games, it was not completed until 1946.  
It staged four track cycling events at Helsinki 1952. 

The velodrome is the home track of two of the city’s cycling clubs and is used for training and competition 
by amateur and elite cyclists. The start and finish point for the Tour de Helsinki (Finland’s biggest annual 
cycling event) since 2007, the 7,000-capacity venue also hosts the Finnish National Track Cycling 
Championships and has staged the Helsinki Grand Prix four times between 2015 and 2018. In recent 
times, the velodrome has been deemed unsuitable for official elite International Cycling Union (UCI) 
events due to its unconventional length (400m) and outdated safety standards. 

Open seven days a week to the general public, the venue also caters for lacrosse and field hockey in 
the summer months, and the artificial pitch at its centre is used by three of the Finnish capital’s American 
football teams for their home games.

TA I VA L L A H T I
Also built for the cancelled 1940 Games, the venue staged the canoeing events at the 1952 Olympic 
Games but was deemed too windy for the rowing events, which were moved to a temporary venue at 
Meilahti. The roofed grandstand was enlarged for the Games and still stands today. The venue is now 
known as the Töölö Rowing Stadium and is used by a number of local rowing clubs.

H E LS I N K I O LY M PI C V I L L AG E (O LY M PI A K Y L Ä)
Helsinki has two Olympic Villages, both situated close to each other in the district of Käpylä and not far 
from the Olympic venues and outdoor and indoor training facilities. The first was constructed for the 
cancelled 1940 Olympic Games and provided housing for 500 families following its completion.  When 
the Finnish capital won the right to stage the 1952 Olympic Games, a second Olympic Village  was built.

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesLike its predecessor, it too was turned over for social housing after the Olympic Games, as planned and 
in response to Finland’s housing crisis at the time. Both Olympic Villages continue to provide housing 
today.

The open-air pool in the town of Hameenlinna (an hour’s drive north of Helsinki) is part of the Ahvenisto 
Activity Park and is open from mid-May to the end of August. Now a listed building, the pool closed in 
1985 due to lack of funding for renovation work. A conservation society was founded to raise money for 
its refurbishment, and it eventually reopened in 2014.

The property of the Finnish Defence Service at Games time, the venue and its facilities were refurbished 
for the Olympic shooting competitions. The range was closed in 1993.

The rowing competitions were due to have taken place at Taivallahti. When it was deemed to be too 
windy, they were moved to Meilahti Bay, where a temporary rowing stadium was erected for the Games.

DID YOU K NOW?

An electric scoreboard was installed at the Olympic Stadium for use at the Games. Measuring 12 metres 
across and 5.5 metres high, the scoreboard comprised eight lines of 25 characters and was fitted with 
7,000 light bulbs, a total of 35 per character.

During WWII, the empty pools at Helsinki’s Swimming Stadium were used to store herring and root
vegetables for Finland’s front-line troops. 

In 2017, Ahvenisto swimming pool was named Finland’s Sports Centre of the Year by the Ministry of 
Education and Culture.

Sixteen competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Melbourne / 
Stockholm 1956.

Three of them were in Stockholm, which hosted the equestrian competition 
due to Australian quarantine regulations at the time. Eleven of the venues were 
existing, one was temporary and four were new, two of which are no longer in use 
and one of which has been repurposed. Ten of the venues have been confirmed
as being in use, with data unavailable as to the current status of the Royal 
Australian Air Force Station. The Australian city’s remaining Olympic venues 
perform a variety of functions, from exhibition spaces and concert venues to 
iconic sporting stadiums and facilities used by sports clubs.

Stockholm’s Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for 
the equestrian events (held in June 1956), and the Melbourne Cricket Ground 
performed the same function at the Games proper. The Melbourne Olympic 
Village was built for the Games, while Stockholm had two Olympic Villages, both 
of which were existing. All three remain in use.

The stadium opened in 1853 and was used solely for cricket and Australian football for many years. In 
preparation for the 1956 Olympic Games, a temporary athletics track was installed and a new stand built. 
The athletics track was removed as soon as the Games were over.

Known locally as “The G”, Melbourne Cricket Ground remains one of the temples of world cricket. It is 
also a major venue for Australian rules football, hosting the season’s showpiece match, the Grand Final. 
The MCG staged matches at the women’s and men’s Olympic football tournaments at Sydney 2000, and 
the opening and closing ceremonies and track and field events at the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth 
Games. A venue for concerts and international rugby and baseball matches as well, it is also the home  
of the Australian Sports Museum. 

The venue was renovated between 2004 and 2006. The stand built for the 1956 Games was 
demolished, along with neighbouring stands, to make way for a new North Stand, which took the 
stadium’s capacity to 101,000. A new roof was also added to the stadium. The vast South Stand,  
which opened in 1992 and has a capacity of 45,000, was modernised in 2012.

E X H I B I T I O N B U I L D I N G
Built for the 1880 Melbourne International Exhibition, the venue is still used as an exhibition site, staging 
events in conjunction with the nearby Melbourne Museum. It is one of the last surviving 19th-century 
exhibition buildings in the world and was extensively restored before being declared a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site in 2004.

W EST M E L B O U R N E STA D I U M
Renamed the Festival Hall after the Olympic Games, it became a major concert venue, hosting the likes 
of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Now heritage-protected, it continues to operate 
as an entertainment venue.

OA K L A N DS H U N T C LU B
The venue now provides boarding for horses and hosts events such as horse shows and jumping  
and dressage competitions.

Now known as the Holden Centre, the iconic Olympic Swimming Stadium was built in line with innovative 
design principles. Listed in the Victorian Heritage Register, it remains an architecturally, historically and 
symbolically important building to this day. 

A basketball, netball and concert venue after the Games, it was extensively redeveloped in 2003 – when 
it was returned to its original appearance – and again in 2012/13. It is now the training and administration 
base of Australian rules football club Collingwood.

M E L B O U R N E O LY M PI C V I L L AG E
A village in its own right and designed as a new suburb that would help alleviate the state of Victoria’s 
housing problems at the time, the Olympic Village marked a departure from the tradition of housing 
athletes in dorms and hotels. Here, competitors and officials stayed in semi-detached houses and flats, 
while female athletes had their own quarters alongside the men, having been housed separately at 
previous Olympic Games.

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesSituated in the suburb of Heidelberg West, the village area faced social problems after the Games, 
and many of its 841 individual housing units fell into disrepair. A 1995 urban renewal and revitalisation 
programme transformed many of the dilapidated houses. More recently, the 10-year Olympia Renewal 
Project has seen the demolition of several hundred homes in the village and their replacement with 
modern public housing. The project aims to renew 600 units in all by 2022. The village has its own 
sports centre, primary school, shopping strip and community health centre, which is home to a training 
organisation and a legal service.

Further regeneration will come with the Heidelberg West Olympic Park Master Plan, which will redevelop 
the park – a training venue at the 1956 Olympic Games – and its sporting facilities, which are used 
extensively by local clubs and the community. The plan also involves the creation of an Olympic memorial 
garden to commemorate the park’s history.

Located 75 miles north-west of Melbourne, Lake Wendouree is still used for training and hosts 
competitions in different sports, including rowing, canoeing, sailing and triathlon. Recreational sport and 
leisure activities such as fishing and paddling are also popular on site.

Built for the Olympic Games Stockholm 1912, when it hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies 
and several competitions. In 1956, it hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the equestrian 
events, as well as all the dressage and jumping competitions. 

Listed as a national heritage site and originally intended as a temporary wooden structure, this red-brick 
venue was built in the neoclassical style. It is still used regularly today and has been refurbished on 
several occasions.

Designed to accommodate 20,000 people when it opened, it now stages sporting events such as the 
Diamond League and the Stockholm Marathon, as well as major concerts. It is also used for cross-
country skiing in the winter months, when three 430-metre tracks are laid out.

football team Collingwood, and a public sport and recreation facility.

During WWII, the MCG was requisitioned for military use and occupied by the US Air Force and Marine

With its striking inverted-pyramid design, Melbourne Olympic Swimming Stadium was an early and 
influential landmark in the development of structuralist architecture in post-war Australia. Hailed for its 
brilliance and originality, it won many awards when it opened. 

The Swimming Stadium, Melbourne Olympic Park Stadium, Melbourne Olympic Velodrome and the 
Hockey Field were all located in Melbourne Olympic Park, which was first used as a sporting and 
recreational area in 1860. Redeveloped for Melbourne 1956, the park now forms part of the Melbourne 
Sports and Entertainment Precinct, which is home to the city’s major sports venues.

Construction of the stadium was interrupted by WWII, and it officially opened in 1953. Part of 
the Foro Italico complex in the north of the city, it has been the home stadium of Serie A football  
clubs such AS Roma and SS Lazio since it opened, and the Italian national rugby team since 2012.

The stadium was extensively refurbished for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when its capacity was increased 
to nearly 83,000 and it hosted the final. It underwent further renovation in 2007 to make it a UEFA 
category-five stadium eligible to host Champions League finals, which it did in 2009. It has been a venue 
for European and World Athletics Championships, the Athletics Diamond League, UEFA European 
Championship matches in 1968, 1980 and 2021, and Coppa Italia finals, among other major sporting 
events. It also stages major music concerts and performances.

P I A Z Z A D I S I E N A
Situated in the Villa Borghese gardens, the venue staged its first equestrian events in 1922. Attracting 
the leading riders on the international circuit, the Piazza di Siena International Horse Show is one 
of the top events on the equestrian calendar and was a FEI Jumping Nations Cup Division 1 venue 
between 2013 and 2017. In May 2021, the Piazza di Siena staged the 88th CSIO Roma Master d’Inzeo.

P R ATO N I D E L V I VA R O
Permanent stables and other facilities, including storehouses, were built for the Games. Situated 35 
kilometres outside Rome, Pratoni del Vivaro continues to host equestrian events and was the setting for 
the 2007 European Eventing Championships.

O LY M PI C SW I M M I N G STA D I U M
Located in the Foro Italico complex, close to the Olympic Stadium, the venue is split into a competition 
area, comprising the open-air Olympic pool and diving pool, and a swimming instruction area. It is Italy’s 
national swimming and diving centre and has five pools in all (two covered and three uncovered), as well 
as three gyms.

The venue was refurbished to host the 1983 European Aquatics Championships and expanded for 
the 1994 World Aquatics Championships, which it staged again in 2009. The stadium also staged  
the 2011 Euroleague Water Polo Final Four and will welcome the European Aquatics Championships 
again in 2022.

The stadium stages national and regional swimming, water polo, artistic swimming and diving 
competitions, runs lifesaving activities and courses and swim classes, and is open for recreational 
swimming and educational and social activities.

M A R B L E STA D I U M
As well as hosting the knockout rounds of the hockey tournament at Rome 1960, the Stadio dei Marmi 
was used by athletes to warm up for the track and field events at the adjoining Stadio Olimpico.  
Opened in 1936, the 9,500-capacity stadium staged the opening ceremony of the 2009 FINA World 
Aquatics Championships and in 2016 became the venue for the Global Champions Tour of Rome,  
an annual equestrian event.

Inaugurated in 217 AD, the Baths of Caracalla were regarded as the most impressive baths of the 
era and comprised hot and cold swimming baths, covered and open-air gymnasiums, and rooms 
for gymnastics, wrestling and relaxation. The ground floor of the precinct and a large part of its walls 
remain intact. The site hosted the Grand Premio di Roma car race between 1947 and 1951. It hosted 
artistic gymnastics at Rome 1960 and, in the years since the Games, it has been the setting for 
operas, concerts and dance festivals. It also attracts large numbers of tourists all year round.

The lake has been the venue for several major rowing competitions, from the Italian Championships to 
European Championships, since 1903. It is home to several sailing clubs and the Italian Canoeing and 
Kayaking Federation (FICK). Italy’s national canoe and kayak teams train there. Popular with tourists, 
it offers a range of recreational water activities and sports, as well as opportunities for sunbathing and 
hiking. There are several restaurants on its shores. 

The grandstand and judges’ tower built for the Games have fallen into disrepair. Though their demolition 
has been discussed, they remain standing, as do the concrete piles installed at Games time at either end 
of the lake to hold the lane-marking system in place.

Built in what was a run-down part of the Italian capital, the Village opened in July 1960 and admitted its 
first residents, as planned, after the Games were over. It fell into decline in the 1970s, when the body that 
maintained it was disbanded. Crime became a problem in the area in the years thereafter.

Regeneration came in the 2000s, thanks in part to the opening of a number of cultural sites and 
architectural projects in the surrounding area, including the Parco della Musica to the south of the 
Village in 2002, and the Maxxi National Museum of 21st Century Arts in 2009. The Village, which is 
made up of 33 buildings comprising 1,800 apartments and is home to 6,500 people, is set to undergo 
further redevelopment as part of an extensive urban renewal project that includes the refurbishment  
of the Stadio Flaminio.

U M B E RTO I S H O OT I N G R A N G E
One of three shooting venues used at the 1960 Olympic Games, it hosted the rapid fire pistol, pistol, rifle 
three positions, and rifle prone competitions. Italy’s national range since 1883 and the home of the TSN 
Roma club, the venue has staged several world championships, most recently in 1995.

S S L A Z I O S H O OT I N G C LU B
The venue for the trap shooting competition at the 1960 Olympic Games was completely refurbished 
and equipped with modern trap machines and seating for 2,000 spectators. Founded in 1893, the club 
continues to host competitive and recreational shooting.

The venue hosted group and knockout matches in the men’s Olympic football tournament, 
including the gold-medal match. Built on the site of a stadium used at the 1934 FIFA World Cup, 
the Stadio Flaminio opened in 1959 and had a capacity of 50,000 at the time. It also featured a heated 
indoor pool, a fencing gym and wrestling, weightlifting and boxing facilities.

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesIn the decades that followed, it served as a major concert venue and as a temporary home for Rome’s 
top football clubs, AS Roma and SS Lazio, during the Stadio Olimpico’s renovation for the 1990 FIFA 
World Cup. It was also the venue for the Italian national rugby team’s home Six Nations games between 
2000 and 2011, at which point the stadium was closed. Empty and neglected since then, it has survived 
demolition plans and was awarded funds for refurbishment as part of a major urban renewal plan that 
includes the regeneration of the Olympic Village.

S M A L L  S P O RTS PA L AC E
The first purpose-built venue to be completed for the Games, the venue was home to Rome’s leading 
basketball and volleyball teams for many years. Though it closed in 2018, plans have been approved for a 
EUR 3 million refurbishment and redevelopment of the site, which will restore its status as a major sporting 
venue open to the city’s clubs and schools.

O LY M PI C V E LO D R O M E
The field hockey matches were held on the pitch in the middle of the velodrome. The track hosted cycling 
competitions up until 1968, when problems with the foundations of the stands were detected, leading 
to their closure. The track was still used for training, however, while the infield continued to be used for 
hockey and football until 2006. The velodrome was demolished in 2008. A series of legal disputes since 
then have prevented the site from being cleared and re-used.

C ES A N O S H O OT I N G R A N G E
A shooting range was set up for the long-distance rifle events at the Italian Infantry School in Cesano. 
Though the school continues to operate, the Olympic range has since been dismantled.

The Marble Stadium (Stadio dei Marmi) is ringed by 59 faux Greco-Roman marble statues, each depicting 
different sports.

The Small Sports Palace (Palazzetto dello Sport) was built by the celebrated Italian architect Pier Luigi 
Nervi, who also designed the Torino Esposizioni, which hosted ice hockey matches at the Olympic  
Winter Games Torino 2006.

Occupying the crater of an ancient volcano, Lake Albano gave its name to a lane-marking system  
devised to respond to the challenges that the depth of the water posed. The anchor-based system 
commonly used at the time was rendered impractical by the lake, which was up to 170 metres deep 
in places. In response to this, the Albano system uses buoys and cables and can be installed on any 
suitable body of water, regardless of its depth. It was later adopted as the universal standard by the  
world governing bodies of canoeing and rowing, and it remains in use today.

The streets of the Olympic Village are named after the famous sporting figures and national 
delegations that stayed there. They include Via Chile, Via India, Via Nedo Nadi (a celebrated Italian 
fencer) and Viale Pietro de Coubertin.

The plan to redevelop Flaminio Stadium aims to make it a major concert venue, the permanent home  
of Italian rugby, and the home of SS Lazio’s club museum.

Thirty competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Tokyo 1964, 24 of 
which remain in use today. Nine of the competition venues were existing, 16 were  
new and the remaining five were temporary. One of the new venues has been 
demolished. Eleven of the venues were in Tokyo. The venues that remain in use 
continue to host sport, catering for athletes of all abilities, with some also staging 
concerts and cultural events.

An existing venue, the National Stadium, was the main stadium for the Games, 
hosting the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and several of the competitions. 
Partly existing and partly new build, except for one of its buildings, the Olympic 
Village was dismantled after the Games as planned.

Five venues were used again at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: Tokyo 
Metropolitan Gymnasium, Nippon Budokan Hall, Enoshima Yacht Harbour, Baji

Completed in 1958 for the third Asian Games, the stadium was expanded to accommodate 75,000 
spectators for the 1964 Olympic Games. Afterwards, it staged a number of national and international 
sporting events, including the 1967 Summer Universiade, the 1991 World Championships in Athletics, 
the Japanese Athletics Championships, the final of the Emperor’s Cup – a domestic football competition 
– and the final of the All-Japan Rugby Football Championship. It also staged several matches at the 1979 
FIFA World Youth Championship, including the final. In 2019, the stadium was rebuilt as a new Olympic 
Stadium ahead of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.

continues to be used for research and competitions and hosted the dressage and jumping events at the 
Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 after being rebuilt.

The hockey pitches are part of Komazawa Olympic Park, which was built on the site of a golf course 
and made use of facilities constructed for the third Asian Games in 1958. The park was the location for 
the wrestling and volleyball venues used at the 1964 Olympic Games and one of the football venues. 
The three hockey pitches remain but are used for a variety of sports other than hockey, with the grass 
having been replaced by artificial turf. The park itself is a popular recreational venue for local residents and 
welcomes a number of sporting and cultural events throughout the year.

TO K YO  M E T R O P O L I TA N GY M N AS I U M
Located in Meiji Park, next to the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium Indoor Pool and the National Stadium, 
the gymnasium is a multi-purpose venue that hosted events at the 1967 Summer Universiade, the 
2019 ITTF Team World Cup, the 2018 FIG Individual All-Around World Cup and the Olympic table tennis 
competitions at Tokyo 2020. It has also staged NBA matches, figure skating championships, and 
volleyball and wrestling competitions. The venue is open to the public and runs a number of recreational 
sports programmes.

N I P P O N B U D O K A N H A L L
This martial arts venue was built on the grounds of an ancient Edo castle and inspired by an eighth-
century Japanese temple.

Since the Games, the venue has continued to promote Japanese martial arts, hosting competitions, 
public demonstrations, workshops and lessons for people of all ages across a range of disciplines, 
including judo, kendo, karate, aikido, shorinji kempo and naginata. It staged the judo and karate 
competitions at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.

It is also used for national and cultural events such as the national Memorial Service for the War Dead.  
A number of global artists and acts have performed at the venue, among them ABBA and the Beatles.

The sailing venue at both Tokyo 1964 and Tokyo 2020, it is one of the largest marinas in Japan. The 
harbour stages regattas all year round and has hosted events such as the 505 World Championships, 
the Seahorse All Japan Championship and the K16 Class All Japan Championship. The venue’s 
clubhouse was renovated in 2014, and the site retains the Olympic cauldron erected to mark the Tokyo 
1964 sailing competitions.

TO DA R OW I N G C O U R S E
The venue was originally constructed for the 1940 Olympic Games, which were due to have been held 
in Tokyo but were later awarded to Helsinki, before being cancelled when the Second World War began. 
Located on an embankment of the Arakawa River, the venue was refurbished and expanded for Tokyo 
1964. It was considered as a rowing venue for Tokyo 2020 but ruled out on account of having only six 
lanes and limited space for the required facilities. The finish tower was taken down in 2002, and all that 
remains of the Tokyo 1964 facilities is the boat aligner’s hut. The course is still used for training and 
competitions today.

L A K E S AG A M I
The lake was created by the damming of the Sagami River and was completed in 1947. The facilities built 
for the 1964 Olympic Games had all been removed by 1994, when a new boathouse and offices were 
built. The venue has a 1,000-metre rowing course and is used by university teams for training.

The Village was created on a site that the USA had returned to Japan after housing US Air Force 
personnel and their families for nearly two decades following the end of the Second World War. In 
addition to this existing accommodation, temporary new units were erected to house athletes during 
the Games. Virtually all the housing units were dismantled afterwards, and the land was redeveloped 
between 1966 and 1971 to create Yoyogi Park, home to the National Gymnasium and one of the largest 
parks in Tokyo. A small part of the Olympic Village survives in the south-eastern corner of the park.

The park has an events area that stages events such as concerts and food festivals all year round.

The cross-country event consisted of five sections: three road phases, a steeplechase and a cross-

Today, a number of sports are practised at the park, which also hosts a museum and a cauldron.

The facilities erected for the modern pentathlon equestrian event were temporary and were dismantled 
afterwards. The site is now part of a Japan Ground Self-Defence Force base that is also home to Asaka 
Shooting Range, which staged shooting events at both Tokyo 1964 and Tokyo 2020.

Though the facilities erected for the modern pentathlon cross-country race were dismantled after the

To remind visitors of the link between Tokyo’s two Olympic Games, the Tokyo 1964 Olympic cauldron
 and the Tokyo 1964 Champion Wall were installed at the new Olympic Stadium.

Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium was the location for the funeral of Emperor Meiji in 1912.

Nippon Budokan Hall was the venue for a mixed martial arts match between Muhammad Ali and 
Japanese pro-wrestling star Antonio Inoki in 1976.

The National Gymnasium fuses traditional Japanese architecture and Western modernist aesthetics
and inspired the design of Munich’s Olympic Stadium.

Yoyogi Park’s Sample Garden contains trees grown from seeds brought to Japan from all over the  
world by athletes who competed at Tokyo 1964.

The 72,000-capacity venue opened in 1952 and was used at the 1955 Pan-American Games. It staged 
four matches at the 1986 FIFA World Cup and hosted events at the 1975 Pan-American Games and the 
1990 Central American and Caribbean Games. Now known as the Estadio Olímpico Universitario, it is 
the home ground of Pumas Dorados, the American football team of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma 
de México (UNAM), and football club Pumas UNAM, who play in Liga MX, the top tier of Mexican 
football. Also used for university track and field competitions and training, the stadium is open for more 
than 50 days a year and is visited by over a million people annually.

V I R G I L I O  U R I B E R OW I N G A N D CA N O E I N G C O U R S E
Completed in July 1968 and opened two months later, the six-lane competition course measures 2,200 
metres in length and runs from north to south, following the prevailing wind direction. The venue, which 
also has a training course and permanent seating for 2,100 spectators, is used by several of Mexico City’s 
rowing clubs and is also home to the Mexican rowing and canoeing federations. It stages national and 
international rowing and canoeing competitions and offers a variety of activities for users.

F R A N C I SC O M Á R Q U E Z O LY M PI C P O O L
Situated next to the Juan de la Barrera Olympic Gymnasium, the venue was neglected for several years 
after the Games, before being refurbished and reopened in 2009 as part of a federal government drive 
to encourage more people to exercise. It was further renovated in 2018 to mark the 50th  anniversary 
of the 1968 Olympic Games and to enhance its accessibility. A public pool used by residents and local 
aquatics clubs, it also hosts high-performance training and stages national and international events. 
The borough and city’s sports offices are located in the building.

M U N I C I PA L  STA D I U M
Temporary seating was erected for the hockey tournament and later removed. Renovated in 2014, the 
venue is now known as the Jesús Martínez “Palillo” Athletics Stadium and is located in the Magdalena 
Mixhuca Sports Complex. It hosted the Pan-American Sports Festival that same year and was one of the 
facilities used at the UIPM 2018 Pentathlon World Championships. A multi-purpose stadium, it is currently 
home to some of Mexico City’s American football teams.

AG UST Í N M E LG A R O LY M PI C  V E LO D R O M E
Part of the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports Complex, this open-air velodrome was renovated in the mid-
1990s and refurbished once more in 2016, when an artificial pitch was laid for the use of local soccer and 
American football clubs. The venue and its surrounding esplanade are used by more than 20,000 people 
a week for community sports and local events, though the track is no longer suitable for competition and 
is now mainly used for recreational cycling.

N AT I O N A L AU D I TO R I U M
Opened in June 1952, the auditorium was a venue for artistic and cultural events, trade shows,  
political gatherings and international beauty contests. After being refurbished in the early 1990s, it 
became one of the most important concert and stage venues in the country. It also hosts  
photography and art exhibitions.

The four stadiums that hosted matches at the Mexico City 1968 men’s Olympic football tournament 
(Azteca Stadium, Jalisco Stadium, Cuauhtémoc Stadium and León Stadium) all remain in use. Home to 
clubs playing in Mexican football’s top three divisions, they were all used at the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World 
Cups. The 87,000-capacity Azteca was the venue for the final at all three competitions and is one of three 
Mexican stadiums in the running to host matches at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted jointly by 
Mexico, the USA and Canada.

All of its 904 apartments, which served as accommodation for athletes and the press at Games 
time, were sold on the open market after the Games were over, a strategy pursued by subsequent 
Olympic host cities. Though demand was initially low, the apartments are still occupied by local residents 
today. They command higher prices than in other parts of the city because of their historical value.  

A second village (Narciso Mendoza Olympic Village) was built to house event officials and Cultural
Olympiad participants. Its 686 houses and 470 apartments were also made available on the market
after the Games and remain occupied today.

Also used as a concert venue, the rink formed part of a shopping centre that was opened in 1962 and 
demolished in the 1970s. The site is now occupied by a hotel.

R E VO LU T I O N I C E R I N K
One of Mexico City’s first ice rinks, the venue was built to promote ice hockey. It was remodelled for 
the 1968 Olympic Games. Afterwards, it became a well-known wrestling venue specialising in “lucha 
libre”, a style that enjoys great popularity in Mexico. It held its last wrestling match in June 1997 and was 
demolished a few weeks later. The site is now occupied by a petrol station.

The largest facility of its kind in Mexico, the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports Complex covers an area of  
192 hectares. It comprises four Olympic venues: the Fernando Montes de Oca Olympic Fencing Hall,  
the Juan Escutia Sports Palace, the Jesús Martínez Palillo Athletics Stadium and the Agustín Melgar 
Olympic Velodrome.

The Olympic Stadium forms part of the UNAM Campus, which was added to UNESCO’s World  
Heritage List in 2007. The stadium’s main entrance is adorned by a vast natural stone mural created  
by celebrated Mexican artist Diego Rivera.  

The Olympic Stadium set new design standards and provided the inspiration for Rome’s Olympic 
Stadium and Tokyo’s National Stadium, built respectively for the 1960 and 1964 Olympic Games.  
The Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome was once one of the fastest tracks in the world and saw no  
fewer than 30 world records set before its wooden track was replaced by a concrete one in 1997. 

The National Auditorium has twice been voted best international venue, receiving the Pollstar Award  
in the category in 2002 and the Billboard Touring Award in 2006.

Thirty-two competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Munich 
1972, 22 of which remain in use today. Seventeen of the competition 
venues were existing, 11 were new and four were temporary. Along with the 
temporary venues, four of the existing venues and two of the new venues  
have been dismantled. Eleven of the venues were outside Munich.

The venues that are still in use host major sporting events, provide training 
and competition facilities for high-performance and clubs, and offer residents 
opportunities to play sport at a recreational level. Some of the venues also 
stage cultural events and concerts.

The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and 
several competitions, and remains in use. The Olympic Village was built for 
the Games and remains in use.

recreational space that plays host to sporting 
and cultural events and is used extensively 
by the people of Munich. It was home to seven 
competition venues for the Olympic Games  
Munich 1972.  

Six of them were newly built, and five remain in 
use. The Cycling Stadium was demolished, and a 
new multi-purpose venue is being built in its place. 
The hockey fields were temporary and have been 
dismantled; however, the site is part of the park 
grounds and is in continuous use for many activities.

Also built for the Games, the Olympic Village  
is located in the north-eastern part of the  
Olympic Park. It has become one of the most 
popular residential areas in town – a thriving,  
city-within-a-city neighbourhood with a genuine 
sense of community.

Outside the Olympic Park, six other venues  
were built for the Games. Five remain in use 
and play host to a variety of sporting, cultural, 
entertainment, recreational and leisure activities  
in the region. The Wrestling & Judo Hall was 
demolished.

This multi-purpose stadium had a capacity of 77,000 at Games time. This has now been reduced to 
69,250. A Munich landmark, it forms part of the city’s Olympic Park and stages a wide variety of sporting 
and cultural events. 

The home ground of football clubs Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 Munich for many years, it was the 
venue for the finals of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the 1988 UEFA European Championships. It also
staged the 2012 Special Olympics and is a major athletics venue, having hosted the 2002 European
Championships and the IAAF Grand Prix Athletics Final in 1999. A venue at the multi-sport European
Championships Munich 2022, it is the finish point of the annual Munich Marathon and hosts 
the Oktoberfest rugby sevens tournament. The stadium is also a popular concert venue.

R E I TSTA D I O N,  R I E M / R I D I N G STA D I U M
The home of the Munich Riding Academy, the Bavarian Riding and Driving Association and the Regional 
Association of Bavarian Horse Breeders, this 27-hectare venue was rebuilt and expanded for the 1972 
Olympic Games. The Riding Academy was founded in 1958 and organises jumping and dressage 
tournaments, equestrian festivals and instruction for young riders.

S P O RTS H A L L
Now known as the Olympiahalle, the venue is located in the Olympic Park and was its most visited 
venue in 2019, attracting over 970,000 visitors across 158 event days. Designed as a multi-purpose 
building, it has staged many international competitions and cultural events since the 1972 Olympic

Ice Hockey World Championships finals. It is also a popular venue for shows and music concerts. It 
underwent renovations between 2007 and 2019 while continuing to operate.

Measuring 2,230 metres long and 140 metres wide, the course remains an active competition and 
recreational site. Since the 1972 Olympic Games, it has welcomed several major competitions, including 
two FISA Rowing World Championships and the 2021 European Rowing Junior Championships, as 
well regional and local triathlon and open-water swimming events. 

Used by schools and universities, the facility is home to ten local water sports clubs, the Bavarian 
Rowing Association and the Bavarian Canoeing Association. The course has been a Para-canoe and 
Para-rowing training hub since 2015, and has training facilities for archery, volleyball, speed skating, 
skiing, triathlon and running. It also hosts a public water sports day every year, and part of the course 
is open for swimming in the summer months. The course’s facilities were the subject of a preservation 
order in 2018 and will undergo refurbishment in preparation for the rowing competitions at the multi-
sport European Championships Munich 2022.

SW I M M I N G STA D I U M
A training centre for local water sports clubs, schools and Munich’s Technical University, the venue has 
staged the German Swimming Championships six times, and welcomed 21 million visitors between 1973 
and 2017. Located in the Olympic Park, it has a 50m main pool, a diving well, a 50m warm-up pool and a 
paddling area for children. The facility was extensively refurbished in 2019, as part of which the pools, the 
water-treatment and fire-protection systems were upgraded.

CA N O E S L A LO M C O U R S E AT T H E E I S K A N A L
The course continues to host international, national and regional competitions, and is the home of 
Germany’s National/Olympic Training Centre and two local canoe clubs. The venue for the 2011 ICF 
Wildwater Canoeing Sprint World Championships and the ICF Canoe Slalom European Championships 
in 1996 and 2012, it has hosted more than 20 ICF World Cup events. It will stage the ICF Canoe Slalom 
World Championships for a fourth time in 2022 and has been refurbished for the event, with the existing 
organisation centre and boathouse being renovated. The venue’s grass terraces can accommodate 
crowds of between 8,000 and 10,000.

The course was first used as a canoe slalom venue in the 1950s. In preparation for Munich 1972, a 
sculpted concrete floor was created in the channel and the course was made steeper. Water flow from 
the weir at the top of the channel can be controlled to provide the necessary canoeing conditions. As 
a result, the course does not use pumps, making it more cost-efficient to run. Since 2019, the Olympic 
canoe slalom course has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Augsburg. 

O LY M P I SC H ES D O R F
Completed in July 1972 and situated in the north-eastern part of the Olympic Park, the village  
provided accommodation for 12,000 athletes, coaches and delegations from 122 nations during 
the Olympic Games. It was planned as a residential area for middle- and lower-income families and 
single people, and was fully occupied by the end of 1975. Known locally as the “Oly-Dorf”, it is home 
to around 8,000 people, a quarter of them students. The village is car-free and child-friendly and 
has many green spaces and playgrounds, offering easy access to shops and local amenities. It is  
also well served by public transport.

Comprising seven pitches, the 1972 Olympic Games hockey venue was located in the northern section 
of the Olympic Park. The pitches remain in place and are part of the Zentraler Hochschulsport München 
(ZHS)’s sports facilities. One of them has been converted into a baseball diamond that is used by the 
München Caribes club, and another has been turned into an artificial football pitch used by the club SV 
Olympiadorf München eV. The venue’s grandstands – the largest of which had a capacity of 10,000 –

The individual road race was held on a loop course that started and finished in the town of Grünwald, while 
the team time trial took place on a newly constructed 25-kilometre section of Bundesautobahn  96, a 
motorway linking Munich with the town of Lindau, near the Austrian border. The roads are still in use today.

DID YOU K NOW?

Nearly one square kilometre in size, the Olympic Park was home to the Olympic Village and seven of
the Games’ competition venues: the Olympic Stadium, Sports Hall, Boxing Hall, Swimming Hall, Cycling 
Stadium, Volleyball Hall and the Hockey Facility. Also within its confines were the Werner-von-Linde Hall, a 
number of training areas, the press centre, the Theatron and the Hans Jochen Vogel Square (previously 
known as Coubertin Square). Created especially for the Olympic Games Munich 1972, the park is close 
to the city centre and is well served by Munich’s public transport network.

The Olympic Stadium is instantly recognisable, thanks to its distinctive, transparent tented roof, which 
covers an area of 75,000 square metres and extends to the nearby Olympic Hall and Swimming Hall. The 
canoe slalom course in Augsburg is a national heritage site. Its history dates back to the 17th century, 
when the River Lech was dammed to create a canal supplying water to the city. This manmade stretch of 
water is known locally as the Eiskanal (“ice canal”), as ice was diverted to float down the river.

Twenty-four competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Montreal 
1976, 21 of which remain in use. Fifteen of the competition venues were existing, 
seven were new and two were temporary. In addition to the dismantled temporary 
venues, one of the existing venues has since been demolished. Two venues  
have been repurposed: one existing and one new. Nine of the venues were 
outside Montreal.

The venues that remain in use have helped make Montreal a professional sports 
hub. As well as staging international sporting events, they run high-performance 
and youth development programmes, and are also used by the city’s sports 
clubs, universities and residents.

The Olympic Stadium, which remains in use, hosted the Opening and Closing

STA D E  O LY M PI Q U E D E M O N T R É A L
In use all year round, the 56,000-seater stadium hosts major cultural and commercial events, and national 
and international sporting competitions. For example, it welcomed the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World 
Championships and the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Known locally as the Big O, it was once the 
home of the Expos, the city’s former Major League Baseball team, who left for Washington in 2004. The 
Olympic Stadium has had no resident team since then.

Its athletic facilities have been used continuously by the people of Montreal since the 1976 Olympic 
Games ended, and it was visited by 66 million people between then and 2011. Its tower, which was 
completed in 1987 and extensively renovated in 2017, has been converted into a multi-purpose complex 
which is fully rented out.

B AS S I N  O LY M P I Q U E
Situated in middle of the St Lawrence River, on the man-made Notre Dame Island, the Basin is used by 
eight local clubs offering activities for beginners and high-performance training. It also serves as the Para 
Canoe National Training Centre and has staged many major events over the years, including the annual 
Montreal International Dragon Boat Race Festival.

In 1984, it hosted the FISA World Rowing Championships for the first of two occasions, followed by the 
ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 1986. Its boathouses, spectator stands and athletes’ facilities 
were extensively renovated in 2014. The Basin lies next to a park and lake with a public beach, and is a 
popular leisure destination for local people, attracting more than 50,900 visitors in 2019.

C E N T R E C L AU D E- R O B I L L A R D
As planned, the venue provided local people with a community sports complex after the 1976 Olympic 
Games were over. The centre’s Olympic-sized swimming pool can be divided to create a shallow area for 
beginners, while the multi-sports hall is also a flexible space, with its permanent synthetic flooring suitable 
for a host of sports, such as volleyball, basketball and badminton. The centre’s facilities also include 
athletics tracks, tennis courts, baseball pitches and a diving pool with a 10-metre platform.

111

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesRe-opened in 2009 following extensive renovation work, the complex is a training venue for around 20 
clubs and 250 high-performance athletes, and is the headquarters of Excellence Sportive de l’Île de 
Montréal (ESIM), which has been supporting competitive sport in the Montreal region since 2013.

P I SC I N E O LY M P I Q U E
The venue hosts Canada’s national championships and Olympic trials, and is the training base 
for the country’s Olympic team in 10 sports and the home of the Quebec National Sport Institute 
(INSQ). Located in Montreal Olympic Park, it staged the 2018 FINA Diving World Series and attracts 
approximately 300,000 recreational users a year. Its facilities include a 50-metre indoor pool, a diving well 
and a 50-metre training pool. A major refurbishment of the venue was completed in 2015, and involved 
adapting the diving well to FINA regulations, installing a new water-filtration system and building a 22-metre 
diving platform.

F O R U M
Opened in 1924, the Forum was Montreal’s major ice hockey venue and the home of the now-defunct 
Montreal Maroons from 1924 to 1938, and the Montreal Canadiens from 1926 to 1996. It was also a 
concert venue, playing host to the Beatles and the Bee Gees, among other acts. Renovated in 1949 and 
again in 1968, it staged its last ice hockey match on 11 March 1996. The building was converted into a 
cinema and entertainment centre in 2001.

O LY M PI C V E LO D R O M E
Aware of the limited popularity of track cycling in the Montreal area, the Organising Committee planned 
for the velodrome’s post-Games use and had refrigeration pipes laid in the infield so that the venue could 
be used as an ice rink. The committee also maximised its use during Games time by staging the judo 
competition there. In 1992, the venue was converted into the Biodome. One of Canada’s largest natural 
science museum complexes, it recreates four ecosystems found in the Americas, including tropical 
rainforest and sub-polar regions. Closed in 2018 for renovation, it reopened in 2020.

C E N T R E E Q U EST R E O LY M PI Q U E
Located in Bromont, an hour’s journey east of Montreal, the centre opened in 1965 as a private club. It 
opened its doors to the public four years later. Accredited by the International Equestrian Federation (FEI), 
it stages eventing, dressage, jumping and driving competitions, and offers lessons to riders of all levels.

STA D E M O LSO N  D E L’ U N I V E R S I T É M C G I L L
This is the home of two Canadian football teams, McGill University’s Redbirds and the Montreal 
Alouettes, who play their regular-season matches here. The 25,000-seater stadium was built in 1919 and 
refurbished in 2010.

M O N T R E A L O LY M PI C  V I L L AG E
The Olympic Village comprises two pyramid-shaped twin-tower structures containing 980 apartments. 
An integral part of the Montreal landscape, it housed all the Olympic athletes during the Games, with the 
exception of the equestrian and sailing athletes. Rented out as planned after the Games, its apartments 
were soon fully occupied and remain part of the city’s housing stock to this day.

Built in 1960, this 6,000-capacity venue staged political rallies, wrestling matches, and boxing matches, 
and was also home to a gym, a junior ice hockey team, a lacrosse team and curling teams at various 
times. The centre was demolished in 1996 due to rising operational costs and falling attendance figures. 
The site is now occupied by condominiums and townhouses.

The 100km team time trial was held on a 25km section of the Trans-Canada Highway, which  
connects the country’s Pacific and Atlantic coastlines. The start and finish line were located in front  
of the Fairview Shopping Centre, which still stands today. The facilities and stands erected for the  
event were dismantled afterwards.

C I R C U I T M O N T- R OYA L
The road race was held on the same 12.5km circuit that staged the road race at the 1974 UCI World 
Championships, with riders completing 14 laps. The route ran around Mont Royal, the hill that stands in 
the middle of the city. The facilities and stands erected for the event were dismantled afterwards. After the 
1976 Montreal Games, the circuit was used for various cycling competitions such as the Americas Grand 
Prix and the Jeux du Québec 2016.

DID YOU K NOW?

The centrepiece of Montreal’s Olympic venues is the Olympic Park, home to the Olympic Stadium, 
Olympic Velodrome, Olympic Pool and the Olympic Village, all of which were purpose-built for the event. 
A major cultural, sporting and commercial hub for the people of Montreal, the Olympic Park has received 
over 100 million visitors since 1976.

At 165 metres tall and inclined at a 45-degree angle, the Olympic Stadium’s tower is the tallest inclined 
tower in the world. Offering panoramic views of the Olympic complex and the city, it is visited by hundreds 
of thousands of people a year.

The stadium is one of the most controversial venues of its kind due to a three-year construction  
process in which steep inflation, rising material costs, technical challenges and strikes pushed costs 
above the estimated budget to 795.4 million Canadian dollars. The repayment of the construction deficit  
was structured over a period of 30 years through the creation of a national lottery and a provincial tax  
on tobacco. 

The Bassin Olympique flanks the long Casino Straight of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, the venue for the 
Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix.

Twenty-seven competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Moscow 
1980, 21 of which are still in use. Thirteen of the competition venues were 
new, 13 were existing, and one (which has been dismantled) was temporary. 
Three venues are closed and are being rebuilt. The venues that remain in use 
welcome high-performance athletes, clubs and recreational users alike  
and continue to stage events ranging from major global tournaments to  
local competitions.

The Grand Arena was the main stadium at the Games, hosting the Opening 
and Closing Ceremonies and several competitions. It is still in use and has been 
renamed the Luzhniki Stadium. The Olympic Village was built for the Games 
and remains in use.

Now known as the Bitsa Equestrian Centre, the venue was built close to Bitsa Park, in Moscow’s 
southern outskirts, and opened shortly before the 1980 Olympic Games. One of Russia’s foremost 
equestrian venues, it has competition facilities for dressage, jumping, steeplechase and cross-country,  
a gym, a swimming pool, a shooting range, veterinary services and accommodation facilities.

In recent years, it has hosted events such as the City of Moscow Equestrian Federation’s Autumn Cup 
and the equestrian competition at the 2018 Fourth Summer Youth Games of Russia. In winter months, it 
becomes a winter sports facility, with the main stadium converted into a skating rink and  
the steeplechase circle used for skiing.   

The venue was extensively renovated in 2002 and underwent further refurbishment in 2019, when the 
swimming pool was upgraded and work began on the stables.

PA L AC E O F S P O RTS
The venue for the Olympic artistic gymnastics and judo events and part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, 
the Palace of Sports was constructed in 1956 and hosted several world and European championships in 
a number of sports – including ice hockey, gymnastics, volleyball, basketball and boxing – before being 
used at the 1980 Olympic Games. It has hosted four Ice Hockey World Championships. The home arena 
of the HC Dynamo Moscow ice hockey team until 2000, it also staged the 2005 World Figure Skating 
Championships and the 2001 UEFA Futsal Championships. The arena underwent major refurbishment in 
2002, when its seating capacity was reduced to 11,500.

G R A N D A R E N A
Now known as the Luzhniki Stadium, the venue is the centrepiece of Moscow’s Olympic Complex. 
Built for the 1956 Spartakiade, the stadium was refurbished in 1977 in preparation for the 1980 Olympic 
Games. Renovations included the installation of two large video scoreboards and floodlights with halogen 
lamps to enable high-quality broadcasting in poor light conditions. The stadium was further renovated in 
1996, when its roof structure was upgraded.

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studies 
Visited by 10,000 people a day for sport and recreation purposes, the stadium has since 
hosted the 1998 World Youth Games, the 2008 UEFA Champions League final, the 2013 IAAF 
World Athletics Championships and the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, an event for which it was fully 
renovated and turned into a bespoke football stadium with a capacity of 81,000. It also stages cultural 
events and concerts by leading international acts.

One of four Moscow 1980 venues located in the Krylatskoye Sports Complex. Built in 1973, it staged the 
European Rowing Championships that year. Following renovation work, it hosted the 2014 ICF Canoe 
Sprint World Championships and is also used for local and national competitions. It is the home of the 
Krylatskoye Olympic Rowing Sport Training Centre, Sparta Rowing Club, and the Moscow Dragon Boat 
Club. Both clubs offer competitive and recreational rowing and training for rowers of all levels. The venue 
has permanent stands with a capacity of 3,800, a press centre, and a large sports centre with a number 
of training facilities and state-of-the-art equipment. It is also occasionally used for cultural events, such as 
Moscow’s annual Circle of Light Festival.

O LY M PI C V E LO D R O M E
One of four Moscow 1980 venues at the Krylatskoye Sports Complex, the venue has a Siberian larch 
track, two 3,000-seater stands and a multi-purpose inner area that is used for five-a-side football, 
handball, athletics and other sports. Its other facilities include tennis courts, squash courts, a martial arts 
arena, a gym, a sauna, a café and a hotel. The velodrome stages competitions, including the League 
of Masters, an event for amateur riders that has been held there since 2016, and training across all age 
groups. It is the home of the 52/13 Cycling Club and the Serpantin Cycling Club, which also runs a store 
and has bike storage facilities at the venue.

O LY M P I C V I L L AG E
Built on waste ground in southwest Moscow, the Village provided accommodation for 8,310 athletes and 
delegation staff during the 1980 Olympic Games. As planned, it was converted into state-owned public 
housing afterwards. Around 15,000 people currently live at the Village, which comprises 18 buildings of 
between 16 and 18 floors. Its grounds are home to schools, a shopping centre, a park with cycle lanes 
and sports facilities, and the State Museum of the Defence of Moscow.

The venue was part of the Indoor Stadium complex. Home to an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a diving 
well, a training pool, a sauna and a gym, it had a total capacity of 12,000 and was the venue for the 2002 
FINA Short Course World Championships.

Regarded as out of date, the venue and the nearby Indoor Stadium were closed in 2019 and demolished 
the following year. A new multi-purpose sports complex – comprising a new indoor stadium, a swimming 
pool and an entertainment area, among other facilities – is being built in their place. A 1km jogging track 
will connect the stadium to the pool, which will also feature an aquapark, a diving centre, and tennis and 
squash courts. Construction is scheduled for completion in 2023.

YO U N G  P I O N E E R S STA D I U M
The second of Moscow 1980’s two hockey venues, the stadium was built in 1928 as a training venue for 
talented young athletes. It became known as the Central Youth Training and Competition Complex after 
the Games, when it was mostly used for athletics and football, but not for field hockey. The venue was 
demolished in 2016 to make way for a residential and commercial complex.

Minor Arena and the Swimming Pool. It was one of five complexes used at the 1980 Olympic Games, the 
others being the OlimpiyskiySports Complex, the Krylatskoye Sports Complex, the Sports Complex of 
the Central Sports Club of the Army, and the Dynamo Stadium Complex.

The Grand Arena housed a hotel with accommodation for 360 people.

Misha the Bear was the official mascot of the Moscow 1980 Games and is regarded as one of the most 
well-remembered Olympic Games mascots. Created by children’s book illustrator Victor Chizhikov for 
the Moscow 1980 Games, Misha the Bear was selected from 40,000 submissions as the most suitable 
candidate to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public in the Soviet Union and beyond. It was 
Misha who brought down the curtain on the Moscow Games, a tear rolling down his face as he blew out 
the Olympic flame at the Central Stadium (now the Luzhniki Stadium).

Twenty-six competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Los Angeles 
1984, 21 of which remain in use. Twenty of the competition venues were 
existing, three were new and three were temporary. Two venues have been 
demolished. Eleven of the venues were outside Los Angeles County. The 
venues that are still in use host sporting, cultural and leisure activities and are 
accessed by athletes of all levels, from high-performance to grassroots.

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted the Opening and Closing 
Ceremonies and the track and field competitions. There were two Olympic 
Villages; these remain in use, both of them occupying existing university 
campuses. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was also used at the  
1932 Olympic Games, along with the Rose Bowl. Both will be used again  
at the 2028 Olympic Games.

The racetrack opened in 1934 and has been the venue for some of the United States’ most prestigious 
races, among them the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap. It has also hosted the Breeders’ 
Cup 10 times, most recently in 2019. Santa Anita Park has three tracks: one dirt and two turf. Its main 
grandstand has a capacity of 26,000.

For the equestrian events in 1984, temporary seating for 72,000 people was installed across the
venue’s 320 acres, 23,000 of them at the three-sided arena that hosted the jumping competition  
and was laid out on the racetrack. Sand was laid for the dressage competitions and was removed  
after the Games, as were the temporary grandstands. At Games time, the venue had stabling  
for 2,100 horses.

W E I N G A RT STA D I U M
The venue was built in 1951 and is used by East Los Angeles College’s American football and soccer 
teams. It has a seating capacity of 22,355 and was renovated for the field hockey competition at the 1984 
Olympic Games, with a new turf pitch installed and improvements made to the seating. Formerly known 
as ELAC Stadium, it was renamed in honour of the philanthropist who funded the renovations.

After the Games, it reverted to its original use as an American football and soccer stadium, but hosted an 
international hockey tournament organised by USA Field Hockey in 1990. The stadium has an eight-lane 
400-metre track and stages athletics competitions. It is also used for high-school graduation ceremonies.

PAU L E Y PAV I L I O N
Built in 1965, it is primarily a basketball and volleyball venue and is used by the University of California 
Los Angeles (UCLA)’s women’s and men’s basketball and volleyball teams. After the Games, the 
13,800-seater arena, which is also a concert venue, hosted a US presidential debate in 1988, the MTV 
Video Awards in 1992, and a visit by the Dalai Lama in 1997. It was refurbished between 2010 and 2012, 
and staged the Los Angeles Tennis Challenge in 2013.

LOS A N G E L ES M E M O R I A L C O L I S EU M
The stadium was renovated for the 1984 Olympic Games. A new football pitch was installed, along with 
an advanced drainage system and a new athletics track. The stadium was built in 1921 on the site of an 
abandoned racecourse in the city’s Exposition Park. It hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies 
and track and field events when the city staged the Olympic Games for the first time in 1932, when its 
capacity was 105,000. It will perform that function again, with the exception of some field events, when 
the Games return to Los Angeles in 2028.

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesNamed Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, in honour of local World War One veterans, the stadium has 
been the home of the University of Southern California (USC)’s sports teams, among
them the Trojans, USC’s American football team, since it opened. It has provided the setting for two 
Super Bowls, several World Series baseball matches, and four US Olympic track and field trials. The Los 
Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Dodgers are just some of the many sports teams 
who have called the stadium home at some time or other in its history. Figures such as John F. Kennedy, 
Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and Billy Graham have all addressed large crowds at the stadium, 
which has also played host to the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Bruce Springsteen and Prince, among other 
major acts. The stadium underwent a major refurbishment in 2019.

O LY M P I C SW I M STA D I U M
Located on the USC campus, the stadium has been used by local residents and the university’s students 
since the 1984 Olympic Games, as planned. Now known as the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, it is home 
to USC’s swimming and diving teams and stages regional and national aquatic sports competitions. 
It was the venue for the 1989 US Long Course Championships and the 1993 US National Diving 
Championships. It is also used for recreational and masters swimming, and club triathlon, water polo  
and swimming competitions and training.

The stadium was closed for renovations in 2013, when a new diving tower, locker rooms, a spectator
area, a video scoreboard and two outdoor jacuzzis were added to its facilities.

O LY M P I C V I L L AG E USC
The existing campuses at USC and UCLA were used to accommodate athletes to keep costs down. 
The USC Olympic Village occupied 65 of the campus’ 150 acres and welcomed approximately 4,400 
athletes and coaches from 79 National Olympic Committees. They had access to a bank, a convenience 
store, a hair salon, a post office, a video games arcade and high-performance training facilities. Male and 
female athletes were not separated at the Villages.

O LY M P I C V I L L AG E U C L A
The university’s dorms and facilities were repurposed to house around 2,700 athletes from 60 National 
Olympic Committees. They had access to amenities such as a supermarket, a religious centre, a bank 
and a nightclub. Like its USC counterpart, the UCLA Village was returned to the university after the 
Games and is still used for student accommodation today. 

A third Olympic Village was created for the 1984 Games, with rowers and canoeists competing at Lake 
Casitas staying with their coaches at the University of California Santa Barbara campus.

R OS E B OW L
A temporary cycling venue at the 1932 Games, the Rose Bowl was one of four stadiums to stage the 
men’s Olympic football tournament in 1984. It is a prestigious venue in US sport and synonymous with 
American football. The setting for the annual Rose Bowl Game since 1923, it has hosted five Super Bowls 
and is the home of the UCLA Bruins. It is also well known as a soccer stadium, staging matches at the 
1994 FIFA World Cup and 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup, including the finals of both tournaments. The 
venue will stage matches at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic football tournaments.

The venue was donated to California State University (CSU) after the Games and used for training, 
development and competition, for both professional and amateur riders. It staged the USA Cycling 
Collegiate Track National Championships on several occasions, among other meetings. It was also 
open to the public for recreational use and was used for concerts, graduation ceremonies and other 
events. It was demolished in 2002 to make way for a new stadium for Major League Soccer (MLS) team

same CSU complex. The home of USA Cycling’s national track cycling programme, it stages training and 
international competitions, as well as classes open to riders of all levels. The VELO Sports Center will be 
the venue for the track cycling events at the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028.

LOS A N G E L ES M E M O R I A L S P O RTS A R E N A
Situated next to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Exposition Park, the venue opened in 1959. A 
multi-purpose arena, it was used by the city’s NBA and college basketball teams and as an ice hockey, 
boxing and indoor track and field venue. The LA Lakers moved out of the arena in 1967, with the LA 
Clippers following suit in 1999, the USC Trojans in 2006 and the UCLA Bruins in 2012. A number of other 
teams used and then vacated the stadium before and after it hosted the boxing competition at the 1984 
Olympic Games. It was demolished in 2016 to make way for a soccer stadium that is now home to MLS 
team Los Angeles FC.

The cross-country section of the 1984 Olympic three-day eventing competition took place on a site  
that was converted into an 18-hole golf course immediately after the Games. A nine-hole course was 
added in 2004.

O LY M PI C H A R B O R
The 1984 Olympic sailing events were held at Long Beach Marina, part of which later became the 
Shoreline Yacht Club. Temporary facilities were erected to create the Olympic Harbor and were removed 
after the Games. Shoreline Yacht Club continues to offer recreational sailing to its members and visitors 
today and runs a learn-to-sail programme for adults.

L A K E  CAS I TAS
A reservoir created by the construction of a dam in 1958, Lake Casitas provides drinking water and 
ensures flood control in Ventura County. Prior to the 1984 Olympic Games, it had never staged races or 
sporting events of any kind. Temporary facilities were set up for the Games. These included spectator 
stands, ramps, docks, boathouses and an athlete day village. The site was restored to its original state 
after the Games.

Rowing returned to the lake in 2008, with the founding of the Casitas Rowing Club, which runs teams for 
different age groups and junior camps, and organises local regattas for its members and fun races for the 
local community. Fishing is also very popular at the lake, and a number of non-watersport activities are 
also available for visitors, such as biking and hiking, camping, bird watching and disc golf.

DID YOU K NOW?

Over one million spectators watched the athletics events in the Los Angeles Olympic Stadium at the
1984 Games, with nearly 160,000 attending the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.

Weingart Stadium was used as a location in the 1994 film Forrest Gump, the winner of six Academy
Awards. It stood in for the University of Alabama’s Football Stadium in a scene in which Gump,
played by Tom Hanks, runs from one end of the pitch to the other to score touchdowns.

The musician Bruce Springsteen played over 30 times at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.
His last three shows, in late 2016, were the very last events to be staged at the venue.

The stadium was first used for the 1986 Asian Games. It lies within the Chamshil Complex, which is 
home to four other venues used at the 1988 Olympic Games: Chamshil Baseball Stadium, Chamshil 
Gymnasium, Chamshil Indoor Swimming Pool and Chamshil Students’ Gymnasium. Since the Games, 
the stadium’s capacity has been reduced from 100,000 to 69,500. 

Used regularly by the South Korean national football team, it has been the home ground of football club 
Seoul E-Land since 2015 and stages the finish of the Seoul International Marathon. A major concert, 
opera and festival venue, it also hosted the Seoul Design Olympiad in 2008 and 2009. The sports 
complex is currently being redeveloped. As part of the project, which is due for completion in 2025, the 
Olympic Stadium will be refurbished and have its capacity further reduced to 50,000.

S E O U L E Q U EST R I A N PA R K
Completed in 1986, the venue hosted all the Olympic equestrian events except for the individual and 
team jumping finals, which took place at Seoul Olympic Stadium, and the endurance section of the 
eventing competitions, held at Wondang Ranch. 

At Games time, the park was home to jumping and dressage competition areas, training fields, and a 
canter track. The venue for the 1987 Junior World Modern Pentathlon Championships, it was converted 
into a racetrack after the Games. It has two sand tracks and two sets of stables and is also home to a 
horse museum. A second main grandstand with a capacity of 42,000 was built in 2003. A popular venue, 
it stages some of the Republic of Korea’s biggest horse races and offers other attractions such as pony 
riding, racing simulation machines and ice rinks in winter.

This eight-lane course was first used at the 1986 Asian Games and was upgraded prior to hosting the 
Olympic rowing and canoe sprint competitions, when a new road to the venue was built and the drainage 
system improved. The venue is now mainly used for motorboat races and has been renamed the 
Misari Regatta Canoe and Motorboat Racing Park.

It is also used by the local community as a leisure park and stages cycling competitions, fun runs and 
triathlons. A setting for weddings, school excursions, picnics, sports festivals and private functions, its 
facilities include a football pitch, a jogging course, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and a children’s nature 
education site. Water sports equipment is available to hire.

An outdoor venue with a 333-metre wooden track, the Olympic Velodrome is a multi-purpose facility  
that stages regional and local cycling competitions and is used for training and development. Its infield 
area is used for festivals, football matches and other sports. In 2010, the track was replaced and 
the spectator seating refurbished. The venue houses the offices of the Republic of Korea’s National 
Paralympic Committee.

Opened in 1988, just before the Games started, the Village had a capacity of 15,000. It was built on a 
site on the banks of the Han River, next to Seoul’s Olympic Park, and comprises 86 buildings between 
six and 24 storeys high and 3,962 apartments. Its facilities at Games time included a bank, post office, 
laundrette, nightclub, theatre and religious centre. It was also home to an exhibition on Korean culture. 

The Village helped regenerate a run-down part of Seoul. Its apartments were sold to private individuals 
before the Games and were refurbished before being handed over to their new owners. The apartments 
are still occupied today, and the Village is well served by public transport.

Located in the grounds of the Korean Military Academy in the suburb of Nowon-gu in north-eastern 
Seoul. A competition area with eight lanes for the men’s events and seven for the women’s was set up, in 
addition to temporary seating for 1,000 spectators, a computer room and other facilities. These were all 
removed after the Games.

TO N G I L- R O CYC L I N G C I R C U I T
The team and individual road races were held on sections of the Tongil-ro (Unification Road), north of 
Seoul. The circuit used for the women’s and men’s individual road races was 16.4 kilometres long, with 
the women completing five laps and the men 12 laps. The men’s 100km team time trial took place on 
a 25km section of the road. The road surface was repaired prior to the Games. Prefabricated materials 
were used to erect the facilities required for the events, and an 800-seater stand was erected near the 
finish line. These were all dismantled after the Games.

O LY M PI C PA R K C R OS S- C O U N T RY C O U R S E
The four-kilometre course ran on top of and around the Mongchon Tosong, an ancient earthen 
rampart located in the Olympic Park and built during the days of the Baekje Kingdom, which existed 
in southwestern Korea in the early centuries AD. The temporary facilities erected for the modern 
pentathlon cross-country race, which included a steel stand accommodating 10,000 spectators, were all 
dismantled after the Games.

Seoul Olympic Park’s six Olympic venues are the Olympic Fencing Gymnasium, Olympic Gymnastics
Hall, Olympic Indoor Swimming Pool, Olympic Weightlifting Stadium, Olympic Velodrome and Olympic 
Tennis Courts.

Seoul Olympic Stadium proved a major attraction before the 1988 Olympic Games even began, with
301,924 tourists visiting the venue in 1987. The oldest venue used at the 1988 Olympic Games, 
Dongdaemun Stadium, was refurbished three times between its construction in 1926 and the Games.

The Olympic Park is also an arts and cultural hub. Its Sculpture Garden has a rich and diverse collection 
of modern sculptures by artists from 66 countries, while the Seoul Olympic Museum recreates the spirit 
of the Seoul Olympic Games, offering a wide variety of exhibitions on sport and culture. The park is  
visited by 14,000 people a day.

Thirty-eight competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Barcelona 
1992, 32 of which remain in use. Eighteen of the competition venues were 
existing, 16 were new and four were temporary. One of the existing venues 
has been demolished and another has been closed and remains unused. All 
the 16 new venues are in use and continue to benefit Barcelona’s sporting 
and cultural scene today, staging major competitions and providing training 
and recreational facilities for athletes and the city’s residents.

The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the 
track and field competitions. The Olympic Village was built for the Games.  
Both continue to be used.

V E N U ES I N US E

PA L AU SA N T J O R D I
The multi-purpose venue hosted artistic gymnastics, handball and volleyball and had a capacity of 
nearly 18,000. After the Games, it hosted a wide range of sporting events, including the 1995 World 
Indoor Athletics Championships, the 1997 European Basketball Championships, the 2000 and 2009 
Davis Cup finals, the FINA World Swimming Championships in 2003 and 2013, and the 2013 Men’s 
World Handball Championships. It is also a popular concert venue. Bruce Springsteen, U2 and Madonna 
are just some of the leading international acts to have played the venue. It was expanded in 2009, and its 
VIP seating areas were refurbished in 2020.

R E A L  C LU B D E P O LO
The club was founded in 1897, and its facilities were refurbished for the 1992 Olympic Games. The 
stables were upgraded, the turf replaced and a new drainage system installed. Temporary stands were 
built to accommodate more than 9,600 spectators. The venue continues to host major events. It staged 
the Longines FEI Jumping Nations Cup final for the eighth year in a row in 2021 and was also the setting 
for the equestrian events at the 2018 Mediterranean Games. 

The club’s current facilities include a polo pitch, a competition arena, a training course for jumping, four 
hockey pitches, 31 tennis courts, two squash courts and two swimming pools. The Real Club de Polo 
runs more than 100 tennis, polo, padel, hockey and equestrianism teams and has more than 10,500 
members. Its various sports academies have more than 2,000 participants. The club hosts more than 
160 tournaments a year and is used by over 17,000 athletes annually.

T E R R ASSA H O C K E Y  STA D I U M
Built in 1960, the stadium (now known as the Estadio Olímpico Municipal de Hockey 
Martí Colomer) was refurbished for Barcelona 1992, when two of the complex’s three pitches hosted 
matches. It forms part of a sports complex comprising a swimming pool, a football stadium and an indoor 
centre. Terrassa was the first Spanish city to found a hockey club and it is now home to four, with all of 
them playing in Spain’s top division. The venue is used by these clubs and hosted matches at the 2018 
Hockey Masters World Cup. It will co-host the 2022 FIH Hockey Women’s World Cup with Amsterdam.

O LY M PI C STA D I U M
The stadium was built in 1929 and hosted events at the 1955 Mediterranean Games before falling into 
disuse. It survived plans for its demolition in the 1970s and was completely refurbished in the mid-1980s, 
when its neoclassical facade was fully restored and the pitch was lowered by 11 metres to allow new  
rows of seating to be installed. Situated on Montjuïc, the hill that overlooks the city, it became the focal 
point of the 1992 Olympic Games, since when it has been used for both sporting and non-sporting 
events. From 1997 to 2009, it was the home ground of football club RCD Espanyol. It staged the 2010 
European Athletics Championships and the 2012 IAAF World Junior Championships. In recent years,  
it has hosted major music concerts and has been used as a sports theme park. Plans for its future use 
are under discussion.

B A N YO L ES L A K E
The lake staged its first rowing and water sports competitions in the 1950s. Temporary seating for 4,000 
spectators was erected for the rowing events at the 1992 Olympic Games and removed afterwards. 
Situated 120 kilometres north of Barcelona, the lake was also landscaped for the Games, and the start 
and finish areas were developed.

136

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesThe venue is still used as a high-performance training base and for regional, national and international 
rowing, canoeing and triathlon events. It hosted the 2004 FISA World Rowing Championships and 
the 2019 ITU Triathlon World Cup, among other major competitions. Its facilities include boathouses, 
a gym, an indoor and outdoor pool, and basketball and beach volleyball courts. Founded in 1925, 
Club Natació Banyoles continues to use the lake, offering water sports such as rowing, canoeing, water 
polo and kayaking for people of all ages and abilities, up to high-performance level. The Catalan Rowing 
Federation is also based at the lake, which is a popular recreational destination for locals and tourists.

B E R N AT PI C O R N E L L  SW I M M I N G P O O L
Built in 1970 for the European Aquatics Championships that year, this venue is located in Montjuïc Park 
and is now a municipal sports centre. It was refurbished for the 1992 Games, when an indoor pool was 
built, its seating capacity increased, and temporary stands constructed. The venue, which has a 50m 
indoor pool, a 50m outdoor pool and a diving well, was given back to the city after the Games for use 
by its residents. It was a venue at the 2003 FINA World Championships, the 2013 Water Polo World 
Championships and the 2018 LEN European Water Polo Championships.

T E N N I S D E L A VA L L D’ H E B R O N
Opened in late 1991, the complex had a capacity of 15,000 at Games time and 17 courts, with eight of 
them hosting the Olympic tournaments. After the Games, the venue was opened to the public and has 
since been refurbished, most recently in 2019. The Catalan Tennis Federation is based at the centre, 
which hosts tournaments and runs training camps for juniors.

V E LÒ D R O M (U N I O ES P O RT I VA  D’ H O RTA / V E LÒ D R O M D E H O RTA )
This multi-purpose venue opened in 1984 and hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships that 
same year. Since staging seven track events at the 1992 Olympic Games, its 250m wooden track has 
regularly hosted regional, national and European competitions. The Catalan Cycling Federation is based 
at the venue and uses it as its main training and cycling development hub. As well as hosting an academy 
for youngsters, it is a training base for high-performance cyclists. Renovated in 2015, the venue has an 
artificial football pitch, two futsal courts and other sports facilities open to the local community. It is also 
used for concerts and cultural events.

PA R C  D E L  S EG R E,  L A S EU D’ U R G E L L
Since the 1992 Olympic Games, 18 International Canoe Federation (ICF) World Cup races have 
been held at the venue, including the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in 1999 and 2009. 
The centre also plays host to numerous national and regional canoe competitions and is home to 
Club Cadí Canoë Kayak, a high-performance centre. Used by schools, residents and businesses, it 
offers a wide variety of recreational activities, such as rafting, mountain biking and Nordic walking.

O LY M P I C V I L L AG E
Work on the Village began in 1986. Located in the Poblenou district, close to the city’s port and 
beaches, the Village comprises 21 buildings and 1,993 apartments and helped regenerate the area. 
Its construction involved moving the railway line that ran through the area. It was given over to housing 
after the Games, as planned, and has proved to be a popular part of town, with more than 70 bars and 
restaurants located nearby. There has, however, been criticism of the project’s lack of social housing.  
The former athletes’ dining hall has been converted into a shopping centre and the training centre into  
a multi-sports arena.

The home of RCD Espanyol from 1923 to 1997 (when the club moved to the Olympic Stadium) and a 
venue at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the stadium hosted five matches at the 1992 men’s Olympic football 
tournament. It was sold by the club and demolished. The site is now occupied by apartment blocks, in 
the middle of which lies a garden that was once the pitch.

PA L AU D’ ES P O RTS,  B A R C E LO N A
This multi-purpose venue opened in 1955 and hosted events at the Mediterranean Games that year. It 
later staged matches at the 1986 FIBA World Basketball Championship. The venue was remodelled for 
the 1992 Olympic Games, with its parquet flooring replaced with a synthetic surface to meet the needs 
of the volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics competitions. The venue hosted fewer sporting events after 
the Games due to the construction of the Palau Sant Jordi and was repurposed in 2000 to stage theatre 
productions and concerts. It staged its last production in 2017 and was closed thereafter due to structural 
damage. In 2021, Barcelona City Council announced plans to convert it into a sports technology and 
innovation centre that will form part of the Barcelona Sports Tech Hub initiative. The schedule for the 
venue’s conversion has yet to be announced.

Two new archery facilities were built on a complex of football and rugby pitches: a competition pavilion 
and a training pavilion, in the middle of which stood the archery range created for the Games. The 
competition pavilion was not taken down until several years after the Games, to make way for the 
expansion of Barcelona’s underground system. The training pavilion still stands and is used as a 
changing room for players using the football pitches, which remain in place.

M A R AT H O N A N D R AC E WA L K I N G C I R C U I TS
Both venues were dismantled as planned after the Games. Nevertheless, their locations remain  
popular for walking and running and as general gathering places.

An inflatable version of the Olympic Stadium, standing 10.5 metres high, was used as part of  
a travelling exhibition to promote sport and the Olympic Games. 

As part of Barcelona’s transformation for the 1992 Games, the Estació del Nord, an 
abandoned railway station, was converted into a state-of-the-art sports facility that continues  
to benefit the local community today. Built in 1861 and disused since 1972, it was refurbished  
to host the table tennis competitions. The venue features a sports hall, fitness rooms, a  
heated swimming pool and a fully equipped gym with exercise machines, weights and cardio- 
training equipment.

Twenty-eight competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Atlanta 
1996, 22 of which remain in use today. Seventeen of the competition 
venues were existing, nine were new and two were temporary. Along with 
the dismantled temporary venues, three of the existing venues and one new 
venue have been demolished. One new venue has been repurposed. Nine of 
the venues were outside Atlanta. 

The venues that remain in use host local sports clubs and collegiate and 
professional teams, and they are used for events that range from elite sports 
competitions and matches to grassroots events and concerts.

The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the 
track and field competitions. The Olympic Village was partly existing, partly

Twenty-eight competition venues welcomed the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996.  
Sixteen venues already existed, three were temporary structures and nine were  
new permanent venues built for the purpose of the Games. Of those, eight remain  
in use and are thriving. 

The Georgia Dome was demolished and a replacement venue was built nearby. Three  
venues failed to provide a meaningful legacy, the sites used for the baseball and tennis 
Olympic events were demolished, while the field hockey stadium closed due to financial  
issues and remains empty.

Located on a 1,400-acre site, the venue opened in 1995. Its Games-time centrepiece was a 32,000-
seat arena. All but 8,000 of the seats were temporary. The Olympic equestrian events attracted 600,000 
spectators in all. The venue continues to host national and international equestrian and mountain bike 
events. It is also open for festivals, concerts, rodeos, dog shows, wedding receptions and private 
functions. In 2016, it staged a Grand Prix to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1996 Olympic Games. It 
hosts between 60 and 70 events a year.

This 10,500-capacity venue opened in 1964. The home stadium of the Georgia Bulldogs and the 
University of Georgia’s basketball and gymnastics teams, it is now known as Stegeman Coliseum 
and was refurbished in 1998, 2010/11 and again in 2017, when a new scoreboard, lighting and sound 
systems were installed. In 2020, it was ranked 21st out of 334 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Division I basketball venues.

Completed in May 1996, the venue was designed for use as a baseball stadium after the Games. 
Reshaped a year later to allow the Atlanta Braves baseball team to take up residence, it had its capacity 
lowered from 85,600 to 49,700 and was renamed Turner Field. The Braves remained at the stadium until 
2016, at which point it was renovated and its capacity reduced to 25,000 in preparation for use by the 
Georgia State Panthers, the Georgia State University American football team. The Panthers continue to 
play at the venue, which is now known as Center Parc Stadium.

The stadium track was removed after the Games and given to Clark Atlanta University. The venue 
has hosted several concerts. The Rolling Stones, Metallica and Foo Fighters have all performed there 
since the turn of the millennium. One reason for the Braves vacating the stadium was the lack of public 
transport in the area and the impact this had on attendance figures.

A standalone venue in Gainesville, 90 kilometres north-east of Atlanta. The lake is a man-made reservoir 
created by the construction of a dam in 1956 and has hosted water sports ever since it filled up. Some 
permanent facilities were built for the Games. These included two boathouses, course markings, docks 
and a finish tower with a scoreboard and videoboards. Temporary Games facilities included grandstands 
on a floating platform, tents and an athlete day village. These were all removed afterwards. The venue 
underwent a USD 1.1m renovation in 2014/15.  

The venue continues to host rowing and canoeing events. Since the Games, it has staged three US 
Canoe/Kayak Sprint National Championships, the 2003 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, and 
Canadian and US team trials, among other international and national competitions. The venue is shared 
by the Lake Lanier Rowing Club and the Lanier Canoe and Kayak Club, which run youth development 
sessions and high-performance training and also offer boat rentals and recreational paddling trips around 
Lake Lanier. Both clubs organise regular competitions and events for their members. The venue can 
also be booked for corporate events, conferences, teambuilding sessions, and private functions and 
weddings. 

Lake Lanier has 23 beaches along its shores. Over 7.5 million people visit the lake, its marinas and the 
Lake Lanier Islands Water Park every year.

G E O R G I A  T EC H  AQ UAT I C C E N T E R 
Built on a 14.6-acre site at the Georgia Tech campus, close to the Olympic Village, the venue was 
designed for use by Georgia Tech students after the Games. It has three permanent pools: a 50m main 
swimming pool, a diving well and a 50m warm-up pool. The pool and seats installed for the Olympic 
water polo competition were removed after the Games.

The venue was refurbished in 2003. A leading training centre used by the US swim team – eight 
swimmers who trained there went to Rio 2016 – the venue also hosts national collegiate swimming 
and diving championships. It runs swimming and diving classes for all age groups, as well as lifeguard
classes and scuba programmes. Its facilities include a gym, six basketball courts, three dance
studios and an elevated four-lane running track. The venue was renamed the James Herbert 
McAuley Aquatic Center in 2015.

O C O E E W H I T E WAT E R C E N T E R
A standalone venue 200 kilometres north of Atlanta, the site has been used for rafting since the first half 
of the 20th century. Whitewater racing events have been held on the Ocoee since 1977. The riverbed 
was re-channelled to create the Olympic course, which was one-third the width of the watercourse, with 
designers using banks to “build a river within a river”. The Ocoee Whitewater Center building was erected 
for the Games and temporary seating for 14,000 people installed. The venue has no permanent seating. 
The hanging slalom gates used at the Games were later removed.

Due to a combination of dams and powerhouses, the upper Ocoee is dry for most of the year, except for 
scheduled water releases in the summer. As a result, the course is filled with water on only 34 days a year, 
on weekends between May and September. The course staged some whitewater competitions in the 
years immediately after the Games, and there are plans to bring regular events back to the venue, which 
has hosted the Ocoee River Championships every August since 2018. 

When the river has water, commercial rafting companies take more than 750 passengers down the 
course every day. It is also used for swift water rescue courses. When there is no water, the centre offers 
alternative activities such as hiking, mountain biking and nature walks. It also organises conferences, 
weddings, corporate retreats, private gatherings and conservation courses for schools. The site and its 
visitor centre receive 300,000 visitors a year.

The main Olympic Village, located on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus, housed 16,500 
athletes and coaching staff, some of them in existing student accommodation and others in new facilities. 
As planned, the new accommodation was converted into apartments for use by 2,442 Georgia Tech 
students after the Games. The Village also comprised a new high-rise dormitory complex built next to 
Georgia Tech, which provided housing for 2,000 Georgia State University students after the Games. 
The creation of the Olympic Village at the Georgia Tech campus increased its student accommodation 
capacity by 70 per cent.  

The Village had a gym, store, pool, health clinic, religious centre and major entertainment centre, among 
other amenities. The entertainment centre was made up of relocatable buildings and was dismantled 
after the Games. Several satellite villages were also set up at the venues outside Atlanta: Athens, 
Cleveland, Columbus, Savannah, Birmingham, Orlando and Washington (DC).

G E O R G I A  D O M E
Built in 1992 and extensively refurbished in 2007, the stadium was demolished in 2017 on account of 
being obsolete. A replacement venue was built nearby. During the Games, when it hosted the basketball, 
artistic gymnastics and handball competitions, the Georgia Dome was split into different zones to 
accommodate each competition.

It hosted the Super Bowl twice, in 1994 and 2000, and three NCAA men’s basketball final four 
competitions. It also staged over 150 college American football games and was used by NBA team the 
Atlanta Hawks for two seasons in the late 1990s. Used as a concert venue as well, it welcomed major 
acts such as the Rolling Stones and Beyoncé.

The Dome’s replacement is the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. This multi-purpose venue is home to NFL team 
the Atlanta Falcons and MLS team Atlanta United FC. The exact site of the Georgia Dome is occupied by 
a parking lot and public park. A plaque celebrating the Dome’s history was unveiled on the site in 2018. 

A LO N ZO H E R N D O N STA D I U M
Constructed in the 1940s, the stadium was extensively refurbished for the Games. It was later the home 
of the professional women’s soccer team Atlanta Beat for several seasons and was used as a location 
in the film We Are Marshall. The venue was abandoned in 2002, when the college that owned it ran into 
financial difficulties and cut its sports programme. Now covered with graffiti and the subject of litigation in 
the past, the derelict stadium continues to stand today.

A secondary hockey venue was used at Atlanta 1996: the Clark Atlanta University Stadium, which is used 
by the college’s athletic teams. During the venue’s construction, the base for an athletics track was laid 
around the pitch. After the Games, it received the athletics track from Atlanta Olympic Stadium, which 
was removed to enable its conversion into a baseball stadium.

STO N E M O U N TA I N  PA R K T E N N I S C E N T E R
The venue had 16 competition courts: a centre court with 8,000 permanent seats, two smaller courts 
with capacities of 5,000 and 3,000, and 13 outdoor courts. It hosted the 1997 US Women’s Hard Court 
Championships and a 1998 Davis Cup tie between the USA and Russia. The centre faced management 
challenges thereafter and was underused prior to its abandonment in 2007. It was demolished in 2018. 
The site remains unoccupied.  

AT L A N TA F U LTO N  C O U N T Y  STA D I U M
Opened in 1965, the stadium was the home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team from 1966 to 1996 and 
the NFL team the Atlanta Falcons until 1991, the former moving to the nearby Olympic Stadium and the 
latter to the Georgia Dome. The venue was demolished in 1997, and the site is now a parking lot for the 
Olympic Stadium. There are plans to turn the site into new baseball and softball parks.

The two venues were located next to each other and shared some of the same facilities and 
infrastructure. The velodrome used a 250m wooden track supported by a steel structure. It was decided 
that the velodrome should be temporary as no potential post-Games operator could be identified for it. 
Both venues were dismantled shortly after the Games and are now part of a songbird and habitat trail that 
runs through a public park, though some facilities remain in place and continue to be used.

DID YOU K NOW?

The temporary seats installed at Atlanta Olympic Stadium for the 1996 Olympic Games were  
removed and subsequently sold at auction following the event.

As part of a recycling initiative, most of the rubble from the stadium’s post-Games renovation  
was re-used for local road repairs.

More than 200 local high-school students were recruited to help decorate the stadium before  
the Games. 

More than two tons of explosives were used in the demolition of the Georgia Dome.  

Mikhail Gorbachev, the former President of the Soviet Union, made a speech on environmental
issues at the University of Georgia Coliseum in 1999.

The Ocoee Whitewater Center is one of only three Olympic whitewater venues to make use  
of a natural river flow. The others are the Augsburg Eiskanal (Munich 1972) and El Segre Sports Park
(Barcelona 1992).

Thirty competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Sydney 2000, 
26 of which remain in use. Nine of the competition venues were existing, 
18 were new and three were temporary. One of the existing venues has 
been demolished. All the new venues remain in use and were built with 
environmental concerns in mind. Four of the venues were outside Sydney.

The venues that remain in use provide the city and wider region with a variety 
of sporting, cultural, entertainment, recreational and leisure activities, and are 
used by athletes of all levels, from high-performance to grassroots.

The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and  
several competitions. The Olympic Village was built for the Games. Both 
continue to be used.

The design project allowed for the reconfiguration of the stadium after the Games, which would see its 
capacity reduced from 110,000 to 83,500, and included a number of environmentally friendly features 
including a rainwater-collection system. Some sections of the lower seating are movable, enabling the 
switch from a rectangular playing area for rugby and football matches to an oval one for Australian Rules 
Football and cricket matches. Though the New South Wales government announced plans in 2017 for 
the stadium’s demolition and the construction of a new stadium on the site, it later reversed its decision 
and went ahead with a refurbishment. Focused on the fans, an investment of more than AUD 10 million 
was made to enhance the event experience at the stadium through digital upgrades like the installation of 
one of the longest straight-run stadium video screens.

More than 27 million people have attended events at the venue since it opened in March 1999. 

The stadium is currently home to three rugby league teams (New South Wales Blues, Canterbury 
Bulldogs and South Sydney Rabbitohs), a rugby union team (New South Wales Waratahs) and the 
national teams for football (Socceroos) and rugby (Wallabies). It hosts more than 50 events every calendar 
year, making it one of the busiest stadiums in Australia.

Australia’s largest indoor arena, the 21,000-seater multi-purpose venue has five levels and facilities that 
include a ballroom, conference spaces and a sports hall. The home of the Sydney Kings, who play in 
Australia’s National Basketball League, it also stages concerts by leading international acts and has also 
hosted UFC fights, supercross, the Invictus Games and school shows. Renamed Qudos Bank Arena, it 
was announced as the fourth highest grossing arena in the world in Billboard’s 2019 Arena Power List.

SY D N E Y I N T E R N AT I O N A L  E Q U EST R I A N C E N T R E
Completed just before the 2000 Olympic Games, the centre has a main arena with a capacity of 20,000. 
Its other facilities include a warm-up arena, an indoor training hall, training arenas, 25 kilometres of trails, 
cross-country courses, administration buildings and stables.

The venue for the annual Sydney International Horse Trials, it is Australia’s main equestrian training and 
competition centre, catering for all levels of rider, from beginners to elite. The indoor training hall hosts a 
variety of non-equine events, including dog trials, trade shows and weddings. Aboriginal sites and early 
European settlements were discovered during its construction, and efforts have been made to keep 
them intact for future generations.

STAT E  H O C K E Y C E N T R E
Renamed the Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre the venue has a main pitch and a warm-up pitch. A 
new state-of-the-art playing surface was installed on the main pitch in 2018. The centre’s Games-time 
capacity was 15,000, though this has now been reduced to 8,000. It is used by a number of hockey 
clubs, including NSW Pride, which has women’s and men’s teams competing in Hockey One, Australia’s 
premier domestic competition. The venue has hosted a number of competitions, including an FIH Pro 
League event early in 2020. Its pitches and other facilities are available for hire for conferences, meetings 
and private functions.

Part of the Sydney Showground, the multi-purpose main arena of this four-hall complex covers an area 
of 22,000m² and is mainly used to stage exhibitions and trade shows. The venue provides permanent 
facilities for the Royal Agricultural Society, which operates the Sydney Showground, and is occasionally 
used for TV productions. Its three adjoining exhibition halls can be hired out for conferences, exhibitions, 
product launches and other events.

SY D N E Y I N T E R N AT I O N A L  AQ UAT I C C E N T R E
Completed in 1994, the venue now known as the Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre has a 50m 
competition pool, a training pool, a utility pool with a four-level diving tower, and a leisure pool. By the time 
of the 2000 Olympic Games, the venue had already received six million visits and was used extensively 
by schools and recreational swimmers, a function it continues to perform today. Though its capacity was 
reduced from 17,500 to 8,500 after the Games, it remains Australia’s largest swimming arena and is the 
venue for the country’s National Swimming Championships.

Aside from swimming competitions, it is used for high-performance training, and grassroots activities 
such as swimming lessons for beginners, the largest swim school in Australia as well as water polo 
and diving clinics, aquarobics sessions, and seniors’ days. This multi-purpose venue also stages 
conferences, concerts, fashion shows and private functions.

N E W  SO U T H WA L ES T E N N I S C E N T R E
Known as the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre, it is home to 16 courts (10 match courts and six 
practice courts). The venue is used all year round for competitions and training and hosts two warm-up 
tournaments for the Australian Open. With a AUD 50.5 million investment, a roof was added to the main 
arena as part of refurbishments carried out in 2020. The main court seats 10,000 people and is named 
after Ken Rosewall, one of Australia’s tennis heroes. It is host to Tennis Australia’s ATP Cup event and

centre offers tennis lessons and coaching for the general public and is the home of Tennis NSW, the 
state’s governing body.

The Sydney Showground was host to the baseball competitions during the 2000 Olympic Games. Every 
year, it welcomes the Sydney Royal Easter Show (Australia’s preeminent agricultural show), the largest 
event in the southern hemisphere, attracting close to 1 million people every edition.

The showground also houses the GWS Giants (Australian Rules Football team) and the Sydney Thunder 
Cricket Team (Cricket Australia’s National Big Bash League). In addition to the Stadium, the Sydney 
Showground comprises over 120,000 square metres of floor space for exhibitions, conferences and 
music festivals.

Profits from every event held at the Sydney Showground are invested back into supporting Australian 
agriculture and rural communities, contributing to the local agricultural prosperity.

D U N C G R AY  V E LO D R O M E
As with all the new venues built for the 2000 Olympic Games, the venue was constructed with the 
environment in mind. Skylights in the roof allow for daytime events to be staged without artificial lighting, 
while air vents in the building’s walls allow for natural ventilation, reducing energy consumption. The 
venue hosted the 2007 UCI Track Cycling Masters World Championships but is mainly used for regional 
and national competitions. It is the main training base of the New South Wales Cycling Association and 
caters for cyclists of all levels, from high-performance to grassroots. Its infield area is used for hockey, 
basketball and football, ensuring its continued use by the local community and schools. 

PE N R I T H W H I T E WAT E R STA D I U M
Completed in 1999, the centre has been used without interruption since the 2000 Olympic Games. 
Open from September to June, it hosts local, national and international canoe slalom competitions. 
Among other events, it was the venue for the 2005 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships and the 
canoe slalom events at the Australian Youth Olympic Festival in 2013. It is the training base for Australia’s 
canoe slalom team, and its grassed banks can accommodate 5,000 spectators.

It is also a popular recreational venue and offers activities such as rafting, kayaking, guided whitewater 
rafting sessions, water rescue training and team-building sessions. Ongoing redevelopment of the 
stadium will see the creation of a permanent high-performance facility, the building of a second 
whitewater channel, and the development of surrounding parkland to enhance community use and 
diversification of the centre’s activities.

The Olympic Village was created thanks to a benchmark project that turned a former naval munitions 
depot into an environmentally friendly residential area, and restored neighbouring wetlands. The new 
suburb of Newington has grown around the Village, which housed 15,000 athletes and officials at Games 
time, and included various environmental features, such as water recycling and solar-powered hot water 
systems. Its mostly two- and three-bedroom houses and apartments were sold or rented out on the 
open market as private residences after the Games, and are all fully occupied today. Many of the Village’s 
Games-time facilities were later converted for the use of local residents, including the athlete medical 
facility, which became a school.

The venue was opened in 1983 and demolished in 2016. A much-used concert and theatre venue, it 
averaged audiences of a million people a year. As a sporting venue, its main function was to host National 
Basketball League team the Sydney Kings, who played there in three separate spells prior to its closure. A 
venue at the 2007 and 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship, the centre was also used for boxing, wrestling, 
tennis and netball. The site is now occupied by a residential development, part of the redevelopment of 
Sydney’s Darling Harbour, and new conference, convention and exhibition facilities have been built in the

Sydney Harbour provided the backdrop for the race. The 1,500-metre swim took place in Farm  
Cove, the transition area was set up at the foot of Sydney Opera House, and the 40-kilometre bike  
leg and 10-kilometre run took in streets overlooking Circular Quay. Though the temporary facilities  
were dismantled after the Games, parts of the course have been used for subsequent triathlons staged 
in Sydney.

Sydney Olympic Stadium’s 30,000m² roof was designed to resemble the shape of a traditional Australian 
Akubra hat. Supported by large white arches, it is covered with transparent polycarbonate to reduce glare 
and shadow on the field of play. 

The public were invited to buy a stake in the Olympic Stadium, with 30,000 memberships sold in all. 

Sydney Olympic Park, including the stadium, is situated on the lands of the indigenous Wann-gal people, 
who are the traditional custodians of the site.

Located on what was once industrial wasteland, 19 kilometres from downtown Sydney, the 16-hectare 
Olympic Park is home to 11 Olympic venues: Accor Stadium (Olympic Stadium), Sydney Olympic Park 
Aquatic Centre, Sydney Olympic Park Archery Centre, Sydney Olympic Park Athletic Centre and Warm 
Up Arena, Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre, Qudos Bank Arena, Sydney Olympic Park Sports 
Centre, the Sydney Showground Pavillions, the Sydney Showground Stadium, the Sydney Showground 
Dome and the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre.

Thirty-three competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Athens 
2004, 23 of which remain in use today. Eleven of the competition venues 
were existing, 20 were new and two were temporary. Eight of the new venues, 
five of them located at the Helliniko Complex, are no longer in use. Five of the 
venues were outside Athens.

While planning and management issues have prevented some of the venues 
from being used since the Games, many continue to be used for diverse 
purposes, including high-performance and recreational sport, hosting 
competitions and housing the city’s leading sports clubs. The future of the 
venues not in use remains uncertain.

The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and the 
track and field and football competitions. The Olympic Village was built for the 
Games. Both remain in use.

Originally built in 329 BC, the stadium had fallen into disrepair in the 19th century before being  
restored for the 1896 Games. The venue for the archery competitions and the finish of the men’s  
and women’s marathons at Athens 2004, the stadium has hosted a number of sporting and cultural 
events. These include the first Balkan Games in 1929 and the opening ceremony of the 1997 IAAF  
World Championships.

156

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesEvery two years, the stadium is also the venue for the official handover of the Olympic flame  
to the organisers of the next Olympic Summer or Winter Games. In April 2010, it opened to the  
public and became a visitor attraction, offering educational programmes for schools and tours.  
It is also a concert venue.

O LY M P I C STA D I U M
Completed in 1982 for the European Athletics Championships that year, the stadium was upgraded for 
the 2004 Olympic Games and a new roof added to ensure its future use as Greece’s national stadium. 
Post-Games, its capacity was reduced from 72,000 to 69,600. A football, track and field and concert 
venue, it is the home stadium of AEK Athens and Greece’s national football team and staged the 1983 
UEFA European Cup final, the 2007 UEFA Champions League final and the 1997 World Championships 
in Athletics. Madonna, Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga are just some of the major singers and bands to have 
performed there. AEK’s home games have been attracting relatively low attendances – just over 14,000 in 
the 2018/19 season.

G A L ATS I O LY M PI C H A L L
A multi-purpose venue, it is currently home to five basketball clubs, offers table tennis coaching for 
players of all abilities – from high-performance athletes to beginners – and stages volleyball matches. It 
also hosts cultural activities, fitness clubs and concerts, and is used as a TV studio. Part of the complex 
houses governmental offices. 

The venue was used by AEK Athens’ basketball team for two years after the Games but fell into disuse 
between 2006 and 2014. It provided a makeshift shelter for asylum seekers in 2015, a situation that 
resolved the local authority disputes that had caused its previous abandonment and led to the venue
reopening in 2016.

O LY M P I C I N D O O R H A L L
Built in 1995 and renovated for the 2004 Olympic Games, the venue was refurbished again in 2016 and 
renamed the Nikos Gallis Indoor Hall in honour of Greece’s most famous basketball player. It hosted the 
1998 FIBA Men’s World Basketball Championships and the 1995 European Basketball Championships 
and is the home arena of professional basketball teams Panathinaikos and AEK Athens. It is also a 
fencing, gymnastics and basketball youth development centre, and hosts concerts and shows. It was the 
venue for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006.

M A R KO P O U LO O LY M PI C E Q U EST R I A N C E N T R E
Built in 2003 and located 43 kilometres from Athens, the venue had a capacity of 15,000 at Games time. 
It has two main arenas: one for jumping and one for dressage, with permanent seating for 6,000 and 
2,000 respectively. 

Though the venue has had issues with post-Games management and alternated closing and has 
seen periods of closure since the Games, it is currently used for national and international equestrian 
competitions. The headquarters of the Hellenic Equestrian Federation since the Games, it hosted the 
2005 Modern Pentathlon World Cup and the 2012 Balkan Riding Championships before going six years 
without staging any competitions. In response, the Athens Equestrian Festival was launched in 2018 and 
the following year the FEI – the world governing body of equestrian sports – organised a World Cup event 
at the venue.

SC H I N I AS O LY M PI C R OW I N G A N D CA N O E I N G C E N T R E
The national training centre for Greece’s rowing and canoe/kayak teams is also one of three World 
Rowing-approved training centres in the world, along with those in Munich and Seville. Unused for some 
years after the Games, it staged the 2008 European Rowing Championships and also hosts domestic 
rowing and canoeing meetings, including the Hellenic Rowing Championships. It opened to the public 
in 2010 and houses a kayak academy for youngsters. The construction of the centre caused some 
controversy due to the close proximity of wetlands. It now welcomes visitors and schools for birdwatching 
and nature activities.

The venue was built for the 1991 Mediterranean Games and extensively renovated for the 2004 Olympic 
Games. It is part of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Maroussi and has two outdoor pools and an 
indoor one, which hosted the diving competition at Athens 2004. While it remains open to the public, with 
the main outdoor pool used for practice and the indoor pool for classes, the rest of the venue is not in use 
given the challenges related to operational costs and infrastructure maintenance.

O LY M P I C T E N N I S C E N T R E
The centre is home to 16 courts, including a main court with a capacity of 8,600 at Games time. The 
venue remains in use and is open to the public, attracting around 300 players a day. It has infrequently 
hosted competitions, staging an ATP Challenger tournament in 2010 and a school tournament in 2019. 
The venue lacks a long-term strategy, and the main court is largely underused due to management 
and operational costs and the shortcomings of its lighting system, which is not suitable for professional 
tournaments.

O LY M PI C V E LO D R O M E
Another venue built for the 1991 Mediterranean Games, the velodrome was refurbished for the 2004 
Olympic Games, when a new roof was installed. It continues to host track cycling meets and is open to 
sports clubs and experienced cyclists. Converted into an indoor venue in 2006, it is the only facility of 
its kind in Greece and hosts the country’s track cycling championships and track cycling cups. It is also 
the training centre of the Hellenic Cycling Federation. The venue has staged the UEC European Track 
Championships (an under-23 and junior competition) twice and the Balkan Cycling Championships on 
five occasions. Proposals to repurpose the venue have been met with opposition.

O LY M P I C V I L L AG E
Built on farmland, the Village was intended as a new residential area of Athens and was designed 
to provide social housing for families on low incomes after the Games. The Village served as 
accommodation for 17,000 athletes during the Games, and its apartments went on the market 
afterwards. Most of them are currently occupied, with economic migrants accounting for around half of 
the Village’s 10,000 inhabitants. Decaying facilities, high unemployment, and a lack of investment and 
public transport are among some of the problems it faces. Its amenities include a hospital, a fire station, 
playgrounds, a church and schools. Of the 32 shops that opened at the Village after the Games, only four 
remained by 2015.

Five out of six Olympic venues at the Helliniko Olympic Complex remain closed and in a state of disrepair. 
They went through political, economic and administrative upheaval and several changes in ownership. 
Built on the site of an airport, they have been used only intermittently since the Games. The ICF Canoe/
Kayak Slalom World Cup took place there in 2005 and the Hockey Centre was used as makeshift 
accommodation for asylum seekers in 2015. There are plans to develop the complex and surrounding 
area as part of a major project (yet to break ground) which will see the demolition of all the venues. 

G O U D I  O LY M P I C H A L L
The venue for the badminton competitions at the 2004 Olympic Games, built on the site of an army 
camp, was converted into the Badminton Theatre in 2007. The original building’s industrial facade was 
the only element to survive the transformation. The venue hosted concerts, plays, musicals and dance 
productions, as well as conferences, business meetings and corporate events. However, the venue is 
currently closed and remains unused.

The weightlifting venue for the 2004 Olympic Games was handed over, as planned, to the University of 
Piraeus afterwards. It was briefly used as a lecture hall and conference centre; however, given its high 
operational costs, it remains closed and unused.

This mountain site, which was close to the Olympic Village, was cleaned in 2002 in preparation for the 
Games, with a large amount of litter and debris collected. All the facilities erected for the competition 
(course markers, stands, etc.) were dismantled after the Games.

The roof added to the Olympic Stadium was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. It had 
a surface area of 25,000m² and weighed 18,000 tonnes. It comprised two sections that were built at 
different locations. It can withstand winds of up to 120km/h and earthquakes measuring 8 on the Richter 
scale. 

The Athens 2004 International Broadcasting Centre was repurposed into a high-end shopping mall that 
offers retail stores, shops and restaurants, offices, a gymnasium and facilities for children. Additionally, it 
hosts a state-of-the-art aquarium and the Athens Olympic Museum. It is located next to the “Spiros Louis” 
Olympic Athletic Centre of Athens, which contains many Olympic venues such as the Olympic Stadium, 
the Olympic Velodrome and the Olympic Tennis Centre.

A total of 39 competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Beijing 
2008: 18 of them new, 12 existing and nine temporary. Thirty of these venues 
remain in use, for sports, cultural and recreational activities. Seven out of the 
nine temporary venues have been dismantled as planned, one remains in 
use, and one was not dismantled as planned but is not in use.

The National Stadium was the main hub of the Games, hosting the Opening 
and Closing Ceremonies. Beijing Olympic Village was built for the Games and

Also known as the Bird’s Nest on account of its distinctive, award-winning steel structure, it has become 
one of Beijing’s best-known landmarks and has attracted more than 30 million visitors since its opening. 
The venue continues to be used for national and international competitions. Located in the Olympic Park, 
it hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.

Better known as the Water Cube, it has become another Beijing landmark. This multi-functional sports, 
recreation and fitness venue is mainly used as an aquatic sports training facility, but it continues to 
host national and international events and is also open to the public, receiving 3,000 visitors a day. The 
venue was refurbished in 2010, when a water park, exhibition hall, stores and restaurants were added. 
It underwent further refurbishment in 2020, in preparation for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, 
when it staged the curling events.

Home to a number of sports teams, this privately run venue stages more than 100 sports and cultural 
events per year, including concerts by world-renowned artists. The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 
ice hockey competitions were held here.

Though the canoe slalom course was emptied after the Games and is used intermittently, the rest  
of the venue remains open to sporting events and to recreational water activities, such as sailing  
lessons, wakeboarding and water skiing. It has also hosted local water sports events and some 
international events.

This existing venue located by the Laoshan Velodrome was opened to the public just after the Games 
and has now been converted into a leisure park.

The centre has hosted the ATP 500 China Open since 2009. A new centre court, the National Tennis 
Stadium, was opened in 2011. Featuring a retractable roof, the stadium has a capacity of 15,000, the  
fifth largest in the world. When it is not hosting events, the centre opens to the public, who can rent the 
courts out.

After accommodating 16,000 athletes at Beijing 2008, the Olympic Village’s apartments were refurbished 
for residential purposes and placed on the market. Its occupancy rate was 95 per cent by 2016. The 
city’s public transport network has been expanded to serve the area, with the construction of new 
subway lines. During the Village’s construction, concerns were raised about worker conditions and 
the displacement of local residents. Six auxiliary accommodation sites were used at Beijing 2008: in 
Quingdao, Hong Kong, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang and Qinhuangdao.

The venue has mainly been used for cycling training since the Games, and has hosted only a small 
number of local and national cycling competitions. It is also used for other sports on an occasional basis.

H O N G  KO N G O LY M PI C E Q U EST R I A N V E N U E (B E AS R I V E R)
The venue hosted the equestrian events at the 2010 Asian Games and continues to stage a large number 
of dressage, show jumping and cross-country events at all levels, from grassroots to high-performance. 
It is also home to a riding school that offers services to Hong Kong Jockey Club members and other 
permitted users.

The venue was located at the Ming Tombs Reservoir, an hour’s drive north of central Beijing. The  
1.5km swim was held in the reservoir, with the 40km bike section and 10km run taking place on the 
reservoir dam itself and the surrounding roads. The facilities and stands erected for the Games were 
dismantled afterwards.

B E IJ I N G O LY M PI C G R E E N H O C K E Y STA D I U M:
After Beijing 2008, the stadium was used by the public for ball games. Both it and the neighbouring 
Olympic Green Archery Field – another temporary Games venue – have now been dismantled to make 
way for the National Speed Skating Oval, which hosted the speed skating competitions at the Olympic 
Winter Games Beijing 2022.

DID YOU K NOW?

At the time of its construction, the Bird’s Nest was the world’s largest steel structure, with 26km of 
unwrapped steel used. With a capacity of 91,000, it was the largest venue used at Beijing 2008,
though the capacity has since been reduced to 80,000.

The distinctive facade of the Water Cube is inspired by soap bubbles and allows daylight to enter the
building, helping to save up to 55 per cent on lighting energy for the venue. 

The Ming Tombs Reservoir, the venue for the triathlon competitions, is so called because of its  
proximity to the Ming Tombs, a series of mausoleums built by the emperors of China’s Ming dynasty.

Beijing 2008 had more competition venues – 39 – than any other Olympic Games.

Beijing’s Olympic Village is located in a park that is twice the size of New York’s Central Park.

Thirty competition venues were used for the Olympic Games London 2012. 
Thirteen of the competition venues were existing, six were new and eleven 
were temporary. Out of the eleven temporary venues, nine have been 
dismantled. One of the existing venues was demolished. Twenty venues 
remain in use today, including two temporary ones which became permanent. 
Eight of the venues were outside London. 

The venues still in use host sports, cultural, entertainment and leisure 
activities, cater for athletes of all levels of ability, and stage competitions that 
range from world championships to school events.

The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the 
track and field competitions. The Olympic Village was built for the Games. 
Both are still in use.

Originally known as the Millennium Dome and built to celebrate the new millennium, the venue opened 
on 31 December 1999. Underused in the years that followed, it closed its doors before being refurbished 
and reopening in 2007, when it was renamed the North Greenwich Arena. Now known as the O2 Arena, 
it has hosted more than 2,000 events, for which over 25 million tickets have been sold. At 20,000, it has 
the second-highest capacity for an indoor arena in the UK. 

A multi-purpose entertainment, cultural and sporting venue, it provides the setting for the ATP Finals, the 
final event of the men’s professional tennis season. Also home to an exhibition centre, a live music club 
and restaurants, it offers rooftop tours to visitors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the arena was made 
available to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) for staff training.

Built in the 1930s and a swimming venue at the 1948 Olympic Games, when it was known as the Empire 
Pool, the venue was awarded Grade II-listed status in 1976 and renamed Wembley Arena two years 
later. It was extensively refurbished in 2006 and renamed the SSE Arena in 2014. It hosts more than 100 
events a year, including sports events, shows and concerts. In 2018 alone, it attracted more than a million 
visitors.

LO N D O N O LY M PI C STA D I U M
The stadium forms part of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which was built on a brownfield site in a part of 
the city earmarked for regeneration. With a view to the stadium’s post-Games reconfiguration, removable 
features were installed, and the weight of the structures was kept to a minimum. This reconfiguration took 
place between 2013 and 2016. A new roof covering all the seats was installed, along with retractable 
seating to cover the athletics track and bring the crowd closer to the pitch. The capacity was reduced 
from 80,000 to approximately 60,000, though the venue can host 80,000 for concerts. 

As well as hosting the 2017 IAAF World Championships and matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, 
the stadium became the new home ground of English Premier League club West Ham United, ensuring 
its continued use. Despite its revamp, the stadium has been criticised because of high post-Games 
refurbishment costs, and the deal struck between the Mayor of London and West Ham United, which 
some believe has left taxpayers to fund a high amount of the club’s stadium operating costs.

LO N D O N  AQ UAT I C S C E N T R E
Also situated in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the venue was reconfigured after the Games to ensure 
its long-term use and sustainability and opened to the public in March 2014. It houses two 50m Olympic-
sized pools, a 25m diving pool with boards and platforms up to 10m, a dry diving zone, a state-of-the-
art 50-station gym, a café and a creche. The venue is widely used for community sport, leisure and 
recreation. More than 50 schools use it for lessons, with 300 students benefitting from the venue every 
day. In total, 3,500 swimmers and 600 divers are estimated to visit the centre every week.  

The venue’s construction doubled the number of Olympic-sized pools in the British capital. It offers 
training for high-performance athletes and hosts competitions and events. The venue for the 2014 
FINA World Diving Series and the 2016 European Aquatics Championships, it is also home to a diving 
academy opened by British Olympic diver Tom Daley. 

W I M B L E D O N
The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club hosted the tennis competition at the 1908 Olympic 
Games, at its old location on Worple Road, Wimbledon. In 1921, it moved across the district to its current 
location on Church Road, the venue for the world-famous grasscourt Grand Slam tournament. The 
complex has 41 courts in all, 19 of them used for competition and 22 for training. The two main courts 
(Centre Court and No. 1 Court) are used only for the Grand Slam tournament, and both now have 
retractable roofs. The other courts are open to the club’s members.

Situated on the northern edge of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this naturally ventilated venue is part of 
Lee Valley VeloPark, which also features the BMX Track, a one-mile road course, and several mountain 
bike trails. Reconfigured after the Games, the velodrome stages national and international competitions 
on a regular basis and was the setting for the 2016 UCI World Track Cycling Championships. Open to 
the general public, it is a popular training venue and caters for cyclists of all levels, from amateur to high-
performance. One third of all its users come from local schools and clubs.

Lee Valley Velodrome has a number of additional revenue streams, including retail outlets, renting the 
venue out to businesses, and hosting corporate team-building activities, which fund free access to the 
venue for schoolchildren.

This was the only new London 2012 venue to open to the public before the Games, in April 2011. It 
reopened just six weeks after the Games. The venue features a 300m Olympic standard competition 
course and a 160m Legacy Loop, plus a lake the size of two football pitches. It is home to British 
Canoeing’s High Performance Centre and is the training facility for the British Canoe Slalom squad.

Since staging the London 2012 canoe slalom events, it has attracted more than 3.4 million visitors and 
hosted several elite-level events, including ICF Canoe Slalom World Cup rounds in 2014 and 2019, 
and the 2015 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships, which it will again host in 2023. The centre has 
expanded its visitor offer to include events and activities for families, schools, clubs and community 
groups. These include white water rafting, canoeing, kayaking, hydrospeeding and inflatable obstacle 
courses.

Built for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924/25, the stadium hosted the Opening and Closing 
Ceremonies and the athletics competitions at the 1948 Olympic Games, when it was known as Empire 
Stadium. The stadium was demolished in 2003 and rebuilt, reopening in 2007.

Wembley hosted its first FA Cup final in 1923 and remains the venue for this showpiece match and for the 
League Cup final today. It is also the home of England’s national football team and staged the 1966 World 
Cup final, the finals of the 1996 and 2020 UEFA European Championships, and the finals of the London 
2012 women’s and men’s Olympic football tournaments. 

The stadium has on occasion provided London football clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur with a 
temporary home, and it has been used for several other sports over the years, including rugby league, 
rugby union, American football, speedway, boxing and baseball. It is also a celebrated music venue and 
was the setting for the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. It also hosts corporate events and offers guided 
tours for visitors.

A standalone, man-made venue, it was built in 2006 and upgraded for the 2012 Olympic Games. It is 
owned by Eton College and is home to its boat club. Regularly used for rowing, triathlon and canoe/
kayak training and competitions, it hosted a number of major events prior to the Games, including the 
2006 World Rowing Championship. Since the Games, it has staged the 2013 FISA Rowing World Cup, 
the 2018 ITU Para-Triathlon World Cup, and a host of national and local events, such as the National 
Schools Regatta. The British Canoeing High Performance Team is based at the centre, and 20 state and 
independent schools also use it for training. The venue can be booked for conferences and corporate 
events, and the public are free to use its grounds when competitions are not taking place.

Situated in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and now known as East Village, the former Olympic Village is 
a community of 3,300 homes. Approximately half of them are market-priced homes, around a quarter 
are intermediate “affordable” homes for people on middle incomes, and a further quarter are for social 
rent. The original plans for the Olympic Park proposed 35 per cent of “affordable” housing. More than 
6,000 people live in East Village, and all “affordable” and social rent homes are now occupied. The 
development’s overall occupancy rate stood at 95 per cent in 2016. Around 500 new homes to rent were 
launched at East Village in spring 2019, while a further 1,500 homes were due for completion from 2021 
onwards.

East Village has excellent transport links to the city centre and a wide variety of shops, cafés, bars 
and restaurants. It also boasts three communal children’s play areas, two hotels, a gym, and a health 
and well-being centre. A new school, housed in what was the Olympic health and drug testing centre, 
opened in 2013. There has been criticism from local residents about rent and house price increases and 
gentrification of the area.

Greenwich Park is one of the oldest and most famous parks in London and has been used as a location 
for several films, among them Four Weddings and a Funeral. Its use for the Olympic Games was opposed 
by some local residents, who expressed concern that the equestrian events would cause irreparable 
damage to the park and local ecosystem. Those fears proved unfounded – the venue was returned to its 
normal use after the Games, and all temporary infrastructure was removed.

Part of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the venue was dismantled after the Games and rebuilt just a few 
hundred metres away at Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre. The new centre has become England 
Hockey’s main venue and staged the 2015 European Hockey Championships and the 2017 Men’s 
Hockey World League semi-finals. Its pitches are also used by local clubs and cater for players of all

Located in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this demountable venue was built using environmentally 
friendly materials that could be reused. It housed a competition pool and a warm-up pool and was

Thirty-three buildings were knocked down and more than 800,000 tonnes of earth were excavated and 
decontaminated, where necessary, to build the Olympic Stadium. 

The Water Polo Arena’s silver covering was made of recyclable PVC. The venue’s inflatable sloping roof 
was designed to provide insulation and reduce condensation.

Lee Valley Velodrome is known locally as “The Pringle” because its curving roof resembles the shape of

There is no evidence of post-Games use for the Olympic BMX Centre while two temporary  
venues, the Future Arena and the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, are yet to be fully dismantled.  
In the Olympic Village, also built for the Games, most buildings are closed and not in use.

Now known as the Brazilian National Equestrian Centre, the venue is part of Deodoro Olympic Park, 
which was built on ground belonging to a military base. It is one of two Olympic Parks used at Rio 2016. 
The venue was constructed for the 2007 Pan-American Games and modernised and expanded for the 
Olympic Games. Used by the public and Brazil’s armed forces, the centre hosted 15 competitions in 
2018, including the South American Three-Day Eventing Championships.

R I O O LY M PI C H O C K E Y C E N T R E
Another Deodoro Olympic Park venue, it was built in 2007 and staged matches at the Pan-American 
Games that year. After being renovated for the 2016 Olympic Games, it was closed for two years after 
the Games but has been in use since 2018. The centre, which has three pitches, is used by the Deodoro 
Hóquei Clube for its Brazilian championship matches and is a training base for Brazil’s national hockey 
teams. It also hosts development activities.

This multi-purpose venue was built on the site of the Nelson Piquet International Racetrack to host  
the basketball and artistic gymnastics competitions at the 2007 Pan-American Games. Before the  
2016 Olympic Games, the arena was used as a training centre for Brazil’s artistic gymnastics team  
and hosted a number of sports. Home to an NBA-type basketball court and training court, the 
18,000-seater venue has been in continuous use since the Games, staging concerts, sporting  
events and esports competitions.

M A R ACA N Ã STA D I U M
Designed to be the biggest football stadium in the world, this iconic venue was built for the 1950 FIFA 
World Cup. It was refurbished in 2000, 2006 and 2013. The most recent of those renovations was the 
most extensive and saw the stadium partially rebuilt for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, when it hosted the final. 
It now has a capacity of just under 79,000. 

It was closed for a year after the Games due to governance issues, prompting a misperception  
that it had been abandoned. Since 2017, the Maracanã has been used by football clubs Flamengo  
and Fluminense for their home matches. The stadium also hosts concerts and other types of 
entertainment events.

R I O O LY M PI C STA D I U M
Another 2007 Pan-American Games venue. Temporary stands were installed to take the stadium’s 
Olympic Games-time capacity to 60,000, and a new track was laid. Before the Games, structural 
problems in the roof caused its closure until 2015. A new roof was fitted, which caused some criticism 
of the venue. Renamed the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos after the Brazilian footballer, it is the home 
ground of football club Botafogo, who have signed a 20-year lease to use it. The stadium also stages 
concerts and track and field competitions.

L AG OA STA D I U M
Centrally located, close to Leblon and Ipanema beaches, the venue has existed since 1961 but was 
remodelled for the 2007 Pan-American Games and again for the 2016 Olympic Games, with the 
construction of a new finish tower and renovation of the boathouse among the refurbishments. A natural 
rowing site, it hosts some local and regional events and is used by the Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, 
among other rowing clubs.

The Rio de Janeiro State Rowing Federation is based at the stadium. It is also home to the Rio de 
Janeiro Rowing and Para-Rowing Training Centre, which runs training camps and offers high-
performance development (through partnerships with universities, for example), talent identification 
programmes, and training for coaches and support staff. Plans for the venue to become a fully-fledged 
high-performance training and research centre have yet to come to fruition, however, and water quality 
and lack of access for the community have been causes for concern.

M A R I A L E N K AQ UAT I C S C E N T R E
Part of Barra Olympic Park, the venue was built for the 2007 Pan-American Games. Owned and operated 
by the Brazilian National Olympic Committee, it was refurbished for Rio 2016 and is part of the Brazilian 
Olympic Training Centre. Its facilities include three Olympic-sized swimming pools, a combat sports 
room, a strength and conditioning room, and physiotherapy and rehabilitation rooms. 

The centre is used by 10 clubs and sports organisations and more than 200 athletes, from youth to  
high-performance level, across a number of sports and disciplines, including judo, swimming, diving  
and athletics. It also hosts local and regional competitions and is used by the city’s firefighters and other 
public agencies for training.

The venue’s main arena has a capacity of 10,000. Two temporary courts with seating for 5,000 and 
3,000 spectators were erected for the Games. After the Games, the main arena hosted the FIVB Beach 
Volleyball World Tour and South American Beach Soccer League in 2017. The centre has been open to 
the public since 2018, and eight of the courts are still in use. Admission is free. Political upheaval and the 
lack of a viable long-term governance model have caused uncertainty about the centre’s long-term use.

R I O O LY M PI C V E LO D R O M E
Situated in Barra Olympic Park, the venue had its seating capacity halved to 2,500 after the Games 
and reopened in May 2017. Part of the Brazilian Olympic Training Centre, it is the main training hub for 
the Brazilian Cycling Federation and also offers induction sessions for youngsters and adults. It has 
staged some national and international cycling events, including the 2018 UCI Para-cycling Track World 
Championships. The centre is beset by high maintenance costs, with air conditioning needed to maintain 
a suitable temperature for its 250m wooden track.

D E O D O R O O LY M PI C  W H I T E WAT E R STA D I U M
A Deodoro Olympic Park venue, the stadium had temporary stands installed for the Games. It reopened 
to the public in September 2017. Part of the Deodoro X-Park, it comprises two independently accessed 
channels: an Olympic-standard competition channel that can also be used for rafting; and a training 
channel that is used for instruction and recreation. Popular with the local community for recreational 
swimming, rafting and other water-sports activities, the venue also hosts competitions, such as the 2018 
ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships.

Situated in Barra da Tijuca in the south west of the city, the Village covers an area of 75 hectares and 
is made up of 31 buildings with 922 apartments. At Games time, nearly half the athletes were within 
10 minutes of their competition and training venues. Though the post-Games plan was to sell the 
apartments as luxury condominiums and welcome 2,400 families as part of the development of the  
Barra da Tijuca area, this has not come to fruition, due to economic and political instability and a surfeit  
of properties on the market. As of 2020, the majority of the Village’s buildings were vacant.

R I O O LY M PI C AQ UAT I C S STA D I U M
The stadium was designed as a temporary venue. Its pools were relocated after the Games, as planned. 
In March 2017, the warm-up pool was successfully moved to a military base elsewhere in the city, while 
the main swimming pool was installed a year later at a high-performance training centre for aquatic sport 
athletes in Salvador de Bahia. Due to local and national political complexities, however, the relocation 
process was delayed. The external structure of the stadium is yet to be dismantled and has begun to 
deteriorate as a result, prompting media reports that the venue had been abandoned.

B E AC H  VO L L E Y B A L L A R E N A
Situated on Copacabana Beach – the cradle of Brazilian beach volleyball – the 12,000-seater arena was 
the centrepiece of a temporary complex that comprised five training courts and two warm-up courts. All 
the facilities were dismantled after the Games as planned.

Built beside the Deodoro Arena and the Aquatics Stadium to ensure that all five parts of the modern 
pentathlon competition were within easy walking distance of each other for spectators, the venue, which 
also staged the rugby competitions and was erected around an existing polo field, had a capacity of 
15,000 and was dismantled after the Games as planned.

F O RT  C O PACA B A N A
The fort was built early in the 20th century to protect Copacabana beach and the entrance to Rio harbour. 
It is situated at the southern end of the beach. It provided the start and finish points for the cycling road 
races and the mid-point of the triathlon races. The water just off the fort was used for the marathon 
swimming events. A 5,000-seater stand was erected at the site and dismantled after the Games as 
planned.

M O U N TA I N  B I K E  C E N T R E
A 5.4km-long loop, the Olympic mountain bike circuit featured sections such as Rio Rocks and Coconut 
Beach. After the Games, it was redesigned as a smaller circuit, which remains in use.

The Brazilian National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute has listed the Maracanã Stadium  
as a historic monument.

The Maracanã is Rio de Janeiro’s second most popular visitor attraction after the statue of Christ  
the Redeemer.

The Olympic Golf Course is home to over 100 species of birds – eight of which are endemic to the 
Atlantic Forest biome – and over 263 species of mammals, frogs, snakes and lizards. Biologists were
on site during the construction of the course to oversee management of the local fauna and to protect  
the various species and their habitat.

Three competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games 
Chamonix 1924. Two of them are still in use today, one of which has been 
repurposed. One of the competition venues was seasonal, and the other two 
were built for the Games as permanent facilities.

The Stade Olympique de Chamonix was the main venue for the Games 
and hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, as well as most of the 
competitions. It has since been repurposed and hosts a number of sports.

There was no official Olympic Village.

The venue was built for the 1924 Games. It is still used for training, youth events and national and regional 
competitions.

The hill staged a number of ski jumping competitions after the Games, including the inaugural FIS Nordic 
World Ski Championships in 1937. It underwent four modifications through to 1982 but lost its FIS 
accreditation in 2001 and hosted its last international competition that winter. Efforts were later made to 
raise funds to upgrade the venue and bring it into line with FIS requirements, but these failed when priority 
was given instead to another ski jumping facility nearby.

This multi-functional stadium was the main Games venue, built around an existing speed skating rink 
(the Patinoire du Bouchet). After the Games, the Stade Olympique was opened up to the public for 
recreational ice sports and to clubs for training. It hosted the men’s European All Around Figure Skating 
Championships in 1926 and the cross-country events at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 
1937. Maintenance of the ice sheet was discontinued around 1960. The sheet was no longer in use by 
the time the stadium was repurposed.

It was repurposed into a new multi-purpose sports complex in 1970 and renamed the Centre Sportif 
Richard Bozon. The complex remains in use today. Popular with local residents, its facilities include two 
speed skating rinks, a swimming pool, a squash court, a climbing wall, a gym, an ice rink and an athletics 
track. The complex was formerly the home of Chamonix Hockey Club, the most successful ice hockey 
team in France with 30 national championship titles and 10 runner-up places.

Built for the first time for the 1924 Games, this natural track made of rocks, ice and snow was rebuilt 
every year through to 1950, when it was closed for competition after five athletes were killed at the 
French Bobsleigh Championships that year. The local sports club continued to use the site for training 
until the early 1960s, at which point the City of Chamonix withdrew the concession and the track was 
abandoned.

Parts of the 1.3km course, which runs through a forest and sits at the foot of the Glacier des Pélerins, 
remain visible today. The track is now frequented by hikers and cyclists, though there have been calls for 
the local authorities to renovate it, commemorate its Olympic past and attract more visitors to the site.

DID YOU K NOW?

The ski jump built for Chamonix 1924 was modelled on the Holmenkollbakken, the Oslo ski jumping 
venue built in 1892, that would go on to host the ski jumping events at Oslo 1952.

At the time of its construction, the Stade Olympique’s artificial ice sheet was the largest in the world.

A natural track founded on granite blocks, the Piste des Pélerins was nicknamed the “19 Curves of Hell” 
because of the dangers it posed to bobsleighers.

Chamonix staged the first official FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1937.

Built in 1927 for the II Olympic Winter Games, the Olympic Stadium is now a private house. Also used at 
the Olympic Winter Games in 1948, it lay empty thereafter and fell into disrepair, before being refurbished 
by its current owner, a celebrated Swiss designer. Many of its original features have been restored, while 
the former ice rink in front of the building is now used as a driving range by a local golf club and also hosts 
occasional charity cricket matches.

First constructed in 1903, the Olympia Bob Run is one of the oldest bobsleigh tracks in the world and is 
rebuilt with natural ice and snow every winter, though it does have some permanent curves made from 
stone and concrete. It is a regular on the BMW IBSF World Cup circuit and has hosted 23 IBSF World 
Championships. It will stage the competition again in 2023.

Among other major international competitions, it has hosted the IBSF European Bobsleigh 
Championships 11 times (most recently in 2016), as well as the 2017 IBSF Para Sport World 
Championships, and the bobsleigh, luge and skeleton competitions at the Winter Youth Olympic  
Games Lausanne 2020.

The run also hosts Switzerland’s national bobsleigh, skeleton and toboggan championships and 
several local events, including the Hornschlitten – a traditional toboggan race. It is open from the end of 
December to the beginning of March and is used for training by amateur and high-performance athletes 
and by the Sankt Moritz Bobsleigh Club, founded in 1897. Visitors can ride the run with a professional 
driver and brakeman.

Owned and maintained by the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club, the famous Cresta Run has been rebuilt 
with natural ice and snow every winter since 1884/85. It is still used extensively today and staged 30 
competitions in 2019.

The run has hosted to the annual Grand National race since 16 February 1885. It is the most prestigious 
of the four major classic races held at the venue, the others being the Curzon Cup (first held in 1910), the 
Morgan Cup (1935) and the Brabazon Trophy (1966).

The track welcomes both experienced athletes and the public. Around 12,500 rides are completed on it 
every year, adding up to an estimated half a million rides since it opened.

  S A N K T M O R I T Z E R S E E
The venue for the ski joring demonstration event at the 1928 Games, this lake sits on the southern edge 
of the resort. In winter, it hosts the Snow Polo World Cup, the only “high-goal” polo tournament to be 
played on snow, and the White Turf international horse racing meet, which has been running since 1907. 
The lake also staged the speed skating competitions at the Winter Youth Olympic Games Lausanne 
2020 and is used for sailing in summertime.

This ski jumping hill closed in 2006 because of safety concerns. A local ski club used the venue prior to 
its closure, and though plans were in place for the construction of a new hill, they were not implemented 
due to cost issues. A 90m hill was built next to the existing 70m hill for the 1948 Games.

Though its stands and shooting ranges were dismantled a few years ago, the Skistadion’s trails now form 
part of a 230-kilometre cross-country skiing network catering for both the classic and skating styles.

The Cresta Run and the St. Moritz Olympia Bob Run are the only two completely natural ice runs in the 
world to still stage international competitions.

More than 15,000 cubic metres of snow and 7,000 cubic metres of water are used to rebuild the Olympia 
Bob Run every winter, all without the aid of chemical products.

The Skistadion also hosted a demonstration event at the 1928 Games: military patrol, a team sport in 
which athletes compete in ski mountaineering, rifle shooting and cross-country skiing. 

Ski joring is a sport in which athletes are pulled on skis by horses, dogs or motor vehicles. Horses were 
used at the St. Moritz 1928 event.

All but two of them are also used for high-performance sport.

Only one of the competition venues was an existing site. The rest were built 
especially for the Games. Four of the venues were used again when Lake 
Placid hosted the Olympic Winter Games for a second time, in 1980.

The James B. Sheffield Olympic Skating Rink, also a competition venue still

Now known as the 1932 Jack Shea Arena and part of Lake Placid’s Olympic Center. This much-used 
sporting and events hub has been extensively refurbished over the years, including for the 1980 Olympic 
Winter Games and most recently in preparation for the 2023 Winter World University Games. It was also 
one of several two-time Olympic venues used for the 2019 International Children’s Winter Games.

A popular community skating venue where classes and annual camps are laid on for the public, the arena 
is also the setting for concerts, conferences and other public events. Used by numerous US Olympic 
figure skaters as a training base over the years, the arena now hosts many events, such as the Lake 
Placid Ice Dance Championships.

Also part of the Olympic Center and also used at Lake Placid 1980. Though the venue has not hosted 
a major international ice-sport event since 1990, it regularly stages local, regional and national speed 
skating events. An outdoor facility, it is used widely by local schools, speed skating clubs and the 
local community for recreational skating, speed skating and ice hockey. It was also a venue for the 
2019 International Children’s Winter Games. As part of the Olympic Center’s refurbishment, the venue 
had a new refrigeration system installed, among other upgrades designed to ensure compliance with 
international competition standards. It hosted the start and finish of the 18km cross-country skiing event 
at Lake Placid 1932.

M T VA N  H O E V E N B E R G B O B R U N
The venue has undergone many changes since the construction of the original, natural bobsleigh track 
for Lake Placid 1932. This track was replaced by a new one for the Olympic Winter Games Lake Placid 
1980, with a separate luge track built in 1979. In 2000, both tracks were replaced by a combined
bobsleigh, luge and skeleton track. The centre forms part of the Mount Van Hoevenberg Sports Complex 
and is listed in the American National Register of Historic Places. 

It regularly stages luge, bobsled and skeleton World Cup events. It hosted the IBSF World 
Championships for a ninth time in 2012, and the FIL World Luge Championships for the second time in 
2009. USA Luge is headquartered in Lake Placid and uses the sliding track as its home training track. The 
centre is also home to the Lake Placid Bobsled Experience, which gives visitors the chance to ride down 
the track. 

I N T E R VA L S K I H I L L /O LY M PI C S K I  H I L L
This is the fourth of the 1932 venues also used at Lake Placid 1980. A year-round competition and  
training venue, the complex boasts K-120 and K-90 ski jump towers and two training hills. It has hosted 
a variety of international ski jumping events over the years, including events at the 2019 International 
Children’s Winter Games. Its training facilities are used by the US ski team’s Elite Aerial Development 
Program (EADP).

The complex, which also comprises a Nordic ski loop and biathlon range, is being upgraded to meet  
the FIS’ highest requirements for staging events. As part of the refurbishment, beginners’ slopes and  
a freeride and tubing park will be built to encourage more local residents to use the site.

The Mount Whitney trail was built especially for the Games and staged the 18km cross-country race and 
the cross-country leg of the Nordic combined competition. It is no longer a dedicated cross-country trail 
and is used for recreational cycling, hiking and cross-country skiing.

 C L I F F O R D FA L LS C R OSS- C O U N T RY S K I I N G R O U T E 
Used for the 50km cross-country race, this trail was built especially for the Games. It comprised the 
former North Notch and South Notch trails, which were some of the earliest dedicated ski trails in the 
region and part of a larger network of trails that dated back to the 1920s. With the advent of developed 
ski areas such as Whiteface Mountain in the 1940s and 1950s, however, the popularity of backcountry 
ski trails declined and the route returned to the wild, though parts of it are still used today for recreational 
cycling, hiking, and cross-country skiing.

Running alongside the combined bobsleigh, luge and skeleton track at the Mount Van Hoevenberg 
Sliding Center is the Cliffside Coaster, which opened in October 2020. At 1.4 miles long, it is the  
USA’s longest mountain roller coaster.

Built for Lake Placid’s first Olympic Winter Games, the 1932 Jack Shea Arena is the oldest of all Olympic 
indoor ice rinks. It is named after a US speed skater who won two Olympic golds at Lake Placid 1932.

The four venues used at both Lake Placid 1932 and 1980 will also stage events when the resort hosts the 
2023 Winter World University Games.

Opened in January 2020, the Lake Placid Olympic Ski Jumping Complex’s SkyRide gondola system 
serves the two main ski jumps. A lift takes visitors to the top of the K-120 tower, where a refurbished 
observation deck offers 360-degree panoramic views of Lake Placid and the Adirondack High Peaks. 
The 90-metre hill has a zipline that descends 700 feet to recreate the ski jumping experience.

a protected monument in 2003. Since 2010, some 
passionate bobsledders have occasionally rebuilt the

An open-air venue at Games time, when an ammonia-cooling system was used to create artificial ice, the 
stadium has undergone several renovations since then. It was fitted with a roof in 1964, while a second 
hall with an ice hockey rink and a curling rink was added in the early 1990s, along with two outdoor rinks.

Since 1936, it has been the home stadium of professional ice hockey team SC Riessersee. It is also used 
by women’s ice hockey club SC Garmisch-Partenkirchen and men’s fourth-division ice hockey team TSV 
Farchant. It hosted a Germany national team match at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996 and all 
the matches in the 2012 IIHF Ice Hockey U-20 World Championship Division I Group A.

The country’s national curling performance centre, it has twice staged the Men’s Curling World 
Championships and also hosted a Davis Cup tie in 2009. The venue is open to skaters and the local 
community for training, classes and recreational skating.

One of the largest and busiest ski jumping venues in the world and a listed historical site, the  
Olympia-Skistadion has been renovated on several occasions, mostly with the aim of ensuring it 
complies with FIS rule changes. In 1950, a new jumping tower made of steel, the first of its kind, was 
erected to replace the original wooden construction. The hill was completely rebuilt in 2007 and 
underwent renovation work again in 2019.

It is the venue for the second round of the world-famous Four Hills Tournament, a ski jumping competition 
that takes place between Christmas and Epiphany and attracts crowds of over 25,000 spectators in 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It has also staged many FIS World Cup and Continental Cup events and the 
German National Ski Jumping Championships. Also used for youth and regional competitions, it is 
open for training five days a week and is visited annually by between 400,000 and 600,000 people. Its 
attractions include guided tours, a restaurant and a zipline running from the tower to the stadium area.

G U D I B E R G
The venue for the Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing events at the 1936 Olympic Winter Games, the 
Gudiberg continues to host national and international skiing events. These include a round of the 2007 
FIS Slalom World Cup and the slalom events at the 2011 FIS Alpine Ski World Championships. Its facilities 
were altered and upgraded for both events, with the finish line returned to its 1936 Games location. 
The Gudiberg was also the location for the ski jumping leg of the combined skiing events at Garmisch-
Partenkirchen 1936, which took place on an existing hill.

K R EUZ EC K- G E B I E T
The venue for the downhill races at the 1936 Games, which were held on the Neunerstrecke course. 
Known today as the Olympia or Kandahar run, it has hosted FIS Downhill World Cup races every year

Together with Hausberg and Alpspitze, Kreuzeck forms part of the Garmisch-Classic Ski Area.

A temporary (seasonal) natural bobsleigh track made of ice and snow, it was built and dismantled every 
year as of winter 1910. It regularly held world, European, German and Bavarian bobsleigh championships 
until 1966. A popular destination for local hikers and cyclists, the track was uncovered again in 2002 
by volunteers and was listed as a historical site the following year. The bobsleigh section of the 
SC Riessersee club has been organising commemorative bobsleigh runs on the track since 2013. In 
2015, the Red Bull Bob Heroes event, in which participants raced in home-made bobs, attracted 2,500 
spectators, while an international bob week was held at the venue in 2019. The site is also home to the 
Bob Museum, which tells the story of the track.

A speed skating rink and two ice hockey rinks were prepared on the lake’s frozen surface for the 1936 
Olympic Winter Games, with temporary facilities being set up to accommodate spectators and officials. 
The lake was already a popular location before the Games and is still used for recreational skating when 
frozen, as well as commemorative events such as the Pond Hockey Cup, which was held in 2011 and 
2013 with the same rules and conditions as those at the Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 Games.

The Kandahar downhill course features a section called the Free Fall, which has a gradient of  
92 per cent.

The Olympia Bobbahn was 1,525 metres long and had 13 curves and a vertical drop of  
approximately 130 metres. Competitors reached speeds of up to 120km/h on it.

The Olympia-Eissport-Zentrum was built in only 106 days.

Garmisch-Partenkirchen is Germany’s only Olympic Winter Games host city. The resort joined  
with Munich to submit a candidature to co-host the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, which were

Championships. It will stage the competition again in 2023.

Among other major international competitions, it has hosted the IBSF European Bobsleigh 
Championships 11 times (most recently in 2016), as well as the 2017 IBSF Para Sport World

The run also hosts Switzerland’s national bobsleigh, skeleton and toboggan championships and  
several local events, including the Hornschlitten – a traditional toboggan race. It is open from the end

athletes and by the Sankt Moritz Bobsleigh Club, founded in 1897. Visitors can ride the run with a 
professional driver and brakeman.

Owned and maintained by the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club, the world-famous Cresta Run has been 
rebuilt with natural ice and snow every winter since 1884/85. It is still used extensively today and staged 
30 competitions in 2019. 

The run has been playing host to the annual Grand National race since 16 February 1885. It is the most 
prestigious of the four major classic races held at the venue, the others being the Curzon Cup (first held  
in 1910), the Morgan Cup (1935) and the Brabazon Trophy (1966).

The track welcomes both experienced athletes and the public. Around 12,500 rides are completed  
on it every year, adding up to an estimated half a million rides since it opened.

This open-air venue, which also hosted an event in the winter pentathlon competition, is used by the 
Saint Moritz Skating Club, which offers lessons to beginners and coaching for more proficient skaters. 
It is situated in the grounds of Kulm Country Club, a name synonymous with winter sports in St. Moritz 
and the setting for the opening ceremony and the medal ceremonies at the 2017 FIS Alpine World Ski 
Championships. The roots of winter sports tourism can be traced back to the nearby Kulm Hotel, which 
remains the home of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club and Cresta Club.

This open-air rink sits in front of the Suvretta Haus Hotel, with lessons offered by experienced coaches. 
The hotel also has its own open-air curling rink and lies within easy reach of the nearby pistes.

The venue for the six Alpine skiing events at the 1948 Olympic Winter Games (women’s and men’s 
downhill, slalom and combined). Boasting 155 kilometres of runs and 23 lifts, its slopes have hosted the 
FIS Alpine World Ski Championships five times in all.

This ski jumping hill closed in 2006 because of safety concerns. A local ski club used the venue prior to 
its closure, and though plans were in place for the construction of a new hill, they were not implemented 
due to cost issues. A 90m hill was built next to the existing 70m hill for the 1948 Games.

S K I STA D I O N
Though its stands and shooting ranges were dismantled a few years ago, the Skistadion’s trails now form 
part of a 230-kilometre cross-country skiing network catering for both the classic and skating styles. The 
Skistadion hosted two demonstration events at the 1948 Games: the military patrol competition (military 
patrol is a team sport in which athletes compete in ski mountaineering, rifle shooting and cross-country 
skiing), and the cross-country skiing round of the winter pentathlon competition. 

DID YOU K NOW?

The Olympic Stadium was the focal point of both the 1928 and 1948 Games, and its interior has  
many reminders of the two events, including black and white photographs and an original gold  
medal from 1948.

The Olympia Bob Run is an integral part of the landscape of St. Moritz. The 180-degree Horseshoe  
turn wraps around a road running through the resort, while the end of the run passes underneath  
a railway line.

It takes the Bob Run’s expert builders three weeks to construct the 1,700m track. By contrast, 
construction of the first Cresta Run in 1885 took nearly nine weeks.

The most famous corner of the Cresta Run is Shuttlecock. Situated halfway down the run, it provides
riders who have lost control of their toboggan with a safe landing on a specially prepared area of
straw and snow. Fallers at the corner become automatic members of the Shuttlecock Club, which
has its own tie.

Winter pentathlon was a demonstration event at St. Moritz 1948. Aside from the Skistadion and
Kulm Olympic Ice Rink, three other venues were used to host the competition: the Französische
Kirche, Kurhaus and Salastrains, all of which are still standing today. Winter pentathlon comprises
cross-country skiing, shooting, downhill skiing, fencing and horse riding.

Eleven competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Oslo  
1952. Nine out of the 10 permanent venues are still in use and remain integral  
to grassroots and high-performance sport in the Oslo area. 

Thanks to the Norwegian capital’s longstanding tradition of hosting winter sports 
events and its flourishing recreational and competitive winter sports scene, nine 
of the competition venues were existing sites. Of the other two venues, one was 
built for the Games, and the other was temporary.

Bislett Stadium was the main venue for the Games and hosted the Opening  
and Closing Ceremonies, as well as the speed skating, figure skating and bandy 
events. It has since been repurposed, becoming a leading track and field venue.

Three official Olympic Villages were built for the Games, all of them in Oslo and 
with clear post-Games use plans. All of them are still in use today, providing 
accommodation for students, hospital staff and the elderly.

Thanks to Oslo’s longstanding tradition of staging winter sports events, the city and its surrounding 
area already possessed nine of the 11 competition and ceremony venues needed to stage the VI 
Olympic Winter Games.

Only one of these existing venues is no longer in use. The other 10 venues continue to contribute to 
the city and its thriving recreational and competitive winter sports scene.

One temporary venue was built for Oslo 1952: the Korketrekken Bob Run. Made from snow, it melted 
in the summer after the Games and was not rebuilt. The three Olympic Villages, built for the Games 
but with legacy in mind, are still in use.

Designed as a multi-purpose facility to ensure its use all year round, the Jordal Amfi was upgraded as a 
state-of-the-art artificial ice rink for the Games. Constructed in the same style and on the same footprint 
as its predecessor, the new Jordal Amfi opened in autumn 2020. A venue for national and international 
ice hockey events, the 5,300-capacity arena hosts other sports and events and is connected to an ice 
hockey training venue.

The old Jordal Amfi was the first artificial ice rink in Scandinavia and one of the most modern hockey 
rinks in Europe at the time. Built as a roofless arena, it hosted a number of local, national and international 
ice hockey competitions, including the 1958 and 1999 IIHF World Championships, as well as boxing 
matches. It underwent several upgrades over the years, including the addition of a roof in 1971 and 
refurbishment for the 1999 IIHF World Championships.

B I S L E T T  STA D I U M
Constructed in 1922, the stadium was repurposed after the Games and rebuilt in 2004, in the same 
architectural style and in the exact same location as its predecessor. Now synonymous with track and 
field, it is Norway’s main athletics training and competition facility. It has hosted the prestigious Bislett 
Games every year since 1965, a fixture on the IAAF Diamond League calendar and Norway’s largest 
sporting event. The 15,000-capacity stadium also hosts the country’s annual athletics championships.

When they are not being used for training and competitions, the stadium’s outdoor and indoor running 
tracks are open to the public and Oslo schools all year round. The most-used sports venue in Norway,

Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games usestudies.centre@olympic.orgThe Olympic Studies Centre    www.olympic.org/studiesBislett Stadium is currently the home of football club IL Skeid, who play in the country’s third tier. Norway’s 
national football team also train at the stadium on a regular basis, and it is used regularly for concerts and 
other non-sporting events. The stadium’s speed skating rink was removed in 1988.

Now known as Holmenkollbakken, it is the centrepiece of the Holmenkollen National Ski Arena 
(“Nasjonalanlegg”) and has been in existence for nearly 130 years. Refurbished on 18 occasions, most 
recently in 2008, it continues to host World Cup competitions, world championships and national and 
local events. It has staged the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships on four occasions, welcoming nearly 
600,000 spectators for the most recent of those events, in 2011. The venue also features on the annual 
FIS Ski Jumping World Cup circuit. The viewing platform at the top of the ski jump tower is open to the 
public and offers panoramic views of Oslo and the surrounding forests.

The bob run built for the 1952 Games was temporary because bobsleigh was very much a minority  
sport in Norway at the time. The country had no permanent track and only made its Olympic debut in the 
sport at St. Moritz 1948. Construction costs were thus reduced and the risk of the run being under-used 
after the Games averted. Built with snow and ice, this natural run was 1.5km long and comprised  
13 curves. It was never used for bobsleigh again after the Games but was turned into a luge run as 
planned and hosted the 1955 Luge World Championships. The track was not rebuilt after this. A 2km 
public sledge run was later constructed, partly following the outline of the track, and remains popular with 
both tourists and locals.

A total of 69 athletics world records and 25 speed skating world records have been set at Bislett
Stadium, which hosted 13 world and 10 European speed skating championships between 1925  
and 1986. 

In 1999, Sports Illustrated named Bislett Stadium the world’s fifth most important sports arena  
of the 20th century. 

Holmenkollbakken’s FIS Ski Jumping World Cup round forms part of the Holmenkollen Ski Festival,  
an annual Nordic skiing competition held every March since 1892 and known as Norway’s “second 
national day”.

The 120,000-strong crowd that watched the large hill ski jumping competition at Holmenkollbakken at  
Oslo 1952 is the largest in Olympic ski jumping history.

Holmenkollen Ski Jumping Hill was made with 1,000 tonnes of steel and offers jumpers permanent
protection against the wind.

The Oslo Ski Museum is situated beneath Holmenkollbakken. Founded in 1923, it is the oldest
museum of its kind in the world and tells the story of more than 4,000 years of skiing history,
including Oslo 1952.

Piestewa Peak, KT-22 Mountain and Papoose Peak: the six alpine events at the 1960 Olympic Winter 
Games were held on these three mountains. The first hosted the men’s downhill, KT-22 the men’s giant 
slalom and slalom, and Little Papoose Peak the three women’s events. The women’s slalom and giant 
slalom courses were used when the resort welcomed the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup in 2017, the first time 
World Cup races had been held at the resort since 1969.

Now known as Palisades Tahoe, the ski area is one of the finest in the United States. Home to 6,000 
skiable acres, 270 trails, and an advanced network of 31 lifts, it attracts 600,000 visitors a year.  
With a view to maintaining its status, the resort announced a USD 17 million investment ahead of  
the 2019/20 season.

O LY M PI C V I L L AG E
Built in 1959 in response to the resort’s relative lack of accommodation at the time, the Olympic Village 
accommodated 1,200 athletes, officials and journalists during the Games, and lay within walking distance 
of all the competition venues, with the exception of McKinney Creek Stadium. After the Games it was 
used as a hotel and then a national training centre by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). 
High operating costs forced the USOC to vacate the Olympic Village in 1980, and its apartments were 
converted into modern timeshare condominiums shortly afterwards. Comprising 90 rooms, it now 
provides accommodation for visitors to the resort.

B LY T H M E M O R I A L I C E A R E N A
The venue for ice hockey, figure skating and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, this 11,000-capacity 
arena was a much-used and popular skating venue and a training base for the United States’ leading 
figure skaters. Boasting an avant-garde design that earned it several architectural awards, it was open 
on one side, in line with the International Skating Union’s (ISU) regulations at the time. The arena’s roof 
was insulated in 1982 to reduce energy costs. This had the unintended effect, however, of preventing the 
snow that accumulated on the roof from melting. In March 1983, the build-up of snow caused the roof to 
collapse, causing over USD 1 million in damage. The arena was demolished later in the year and the site 
is now a car park serving the ski resort.

PA P O OS E P E A K O LY M PI C J U M P I N G H I L L
Named after the rock face on which it was built and situated in the centre of the ski resort, Papoose 
Peak Olympic Jumping Hill comprised three hills in all: a K80 “large” hill, which staged the ski jumping 
competition; a K60 “normal” hill, used for the ski jumping leg of the Nordic combined; and a 40-metre 
practice hill. There was no great tradition of ski jumping in the western USA at the time, and the venue 
was little used in the years after the Games. It staged a few regional competitions and underwent some 
refurbishment for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships. It was dismantled in the late 1970s 
and is now the site of the Far East Express chairlift, one of the ski resort’s 31 lifts.

Situated next to the Blyth Memorial Ice Arena, the oval used artificial ice. It was dismantled after the

Erected especially for the Games on the shores of Lake Tahoe, the stadium’s seating and facilities were 
taken down afterwards, as planned. Many of the venue’s trails were restored for public use in 2010. The 
resort now has a Nordic centre of its own. Occupying 40 acres, it offers 18 kilometres of groomed trails 
for skiers of all levels.

DID YOU K NOW?

The resort was recently voted Best Ski Resort in North America three years in a row by USA Today.

Its 31 ski lifts can transport 72,200 people up the slopes every hour.

With its artificial ice and altitude of 1,890 metres above sea level, the Olympic Speed Skating Oval saw 
some fast times at the 1960 Games, with three world records broken in the eight events. It also staged 
the first women’s speed skating events in Olympic history.

Part of the Olympic Village, the Athletes’ Centre used at Olympic Winter Games 1960 remains an integral 
part of the resort, and is home to a bar and a bakery.

Nine competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Innsbruck 
1964. All of them are still in use today, benefitting the local population and high-
performance athletes alike, and also attracting visitors to the city and region.

Four of the competition venues were existing sites. The other five were built 
for the Games. All nine of the venues were used again at the Olympic Winter 
Games Innsbruck 1976, with six of them hosting Olympic events for a third time 
at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympic Games: Bergisel Ski Jump; the Olympiaworld 
Olympic Ice Track, Outdoor Ice Rink and Olympia Hall; and “Olympiaregion” 
Seefeld and Patscherkofel.

An existing venue, Bergisel Ski Jump, staged the Opening Ceremony, while the

One of the world’s leading ski jumping venues and a popular tourist attraction. A ski jumping site since 
1927, when a wooden jump was erected, it was upgraded for the 1964 Olympic Winter Games. Parts  
of the Bergisel site are protected by cultural heritage status.

The location for the Opening Ceremony at Innsbruck 1964, the Bergiselschanze is the venue for the
third round of the world-famous annual Four Hills Tournament, which is held in early January and
attracts sell-out crowds of 28,000. The hill also hosted the ski jumping events at the 1985 and
2019 Nordic World Ski Championships and the inaugural Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012,
when it again staged the Opening Ceremony. 

Formerly a regular stop on the summertime FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix tour, the Bergiselschanze  
is a year-round ski jumping training centre used by Austria’s national ski jumping team, other national
teams from around the world, and three local ski clubs. The venue plays host to other winter sports
such as snowboarding and freestyle skiing. Its spectator area is used as an open-air theatre in the
summer and hosted the Innsbruck Fan Zone at UEFA Euro 2008.

Part of the Olympiaworld complex and now known as the Olympiahalle, this multi-sports venue stages 
ice hockey matches and figure skating events, and hosted matches of the 2010 European Handball 
Championships and the 2011 European Volleyball Championships. It is also used extensively by the  
local community.

Austria’s only outdoor speed-skating rink, the Olympia Eisschnellaufbahn is also part of the city’s 
Olympiaworld complex, which was the Olympic Park at both Innsbruck 1964 and 1976. It is a training 
centre for Austria’s speed skating teams, and is also used for ice skating competitions and recreational 
skating for the general public and schoolchildren. In summer, it is an inline hockey venue, and it also 
stages concerts.

O LY M P I C LU G E A N D B O B S L E I G H  T R AC KS
The venue has hosted six major world championships since 1964 and is a popular tourist attraction in 
both winter and summer, offering visitors Olympic track sliding experiences. Separate bobsleigh and 
luge tracks were used at Innsbruck 1964 before being replaced with a combined, artificially refrigerated 
track for the 1976 Games, which remains in place. Part of the Olympiaworld umbrella brand, the Olympia 
Eiskanal Innsbruck is the training base of the Austrian Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation.

M ES S E H A L L E  (I N D O O R S K AT I N G R I N K )
Rebuilt in 2011, Congress Messe Innsbruck hosts major medical conferences and Interalpin, the world’s 
leading trade fair for Alpine technologies. The venue, which has helped make Innsbruck a leading 
business, trade show and conference hub, also organises concerts and art exhibitions. 

I N N S B R U C K O LY M P I C V I L L AG E
The Olympic Village helped alleviate the city’s post-Second World War housing shortage, with 
apartments made available to local residents after the Games, as planned. Still known locally as the 
O-Dorf, it comprises accommodation built for the 1976 Olympic Winter Games and is currently home 
to around 7,000 people of over 50 nationalities. It is well served by the city’s public transport network, 
and its amenities include nurseries, schools, sports and cultural clubs, health clinics, shops, an indoor 
swimming pool, and a recently built five-floor nursing home.

The venue for the men’s downhill at Innsbruck 1964, the resort can be reached from Innsbruck by cable 
car and is a popular weekend retreat for the city’s inhabitants. Now known as Igls Ski Resort, it offers a 
wide range of winter and summer activities. 

A X A M E R L I Z U M
A small but thriving ski resort, Axamer Lizum was an underdeveloped site prior to the 1964 Olympic 
Winter Games, in preparation for which a hotel, roads, a car park and new chairlifts were built. It has since 
built up a reputation for delivering consistently good conditions, and attracts skiers and snowboarders 
of all ages. One of Austria’s snowiest resorts, it is served by 10 cable cars and lifts and has around 40 
kilometres of groomed slopes, some of which are named after the Olympic races they hosted in 1964.  
It is also the training centre of the Tyrolean Ski Instructors’ Association.

S E E F E L D 
Boasting over 250km of cross-country skiing trails, Seefeld continues to attract Nordic sport athletes  
of all ages and abilities and was the venue for 2019 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships.

TO N I S E E LOS S K I J U M P 
The Tirol region’s other Olympic ski jumping venue, situated in Seefeld, is home to two hills, which  
are used by ski jumpers of all ages and abilities.

The resort of Axamer Lizum is known as Innsbruck’s White Roof, a reference to the city’s famous
Golden Roof landmark.

In 1988, the spectator area at the Bergiselschanze hosted a mass given by Pope John Paul II, an
event that attracted 60,000 people.

The 14 bends of the Olympic Ice Track include the famous 270-degree banked Kreisel corner, where
bobsleighers and lugers are subjected to 1.5 g-force.

Some 689 apartments were built at the Olympic Village for Innsbruck 1964, with a further 642 being
added for Innsbruck 1976. Housing was in short supply in the city for many years after the Second
World War. More than half of the city’s residential buildings were destroyed during the conflict, and
the effects of this devastation were still a major issue as late as the 1960s.

Autrans is France’s cross-country skiing capital. The resort’s 180 kilometres of trails are popular with 
skiers of all levels and provide the venue for La Foulée Blanche, a week-long cross-country skiing event. 
Autrans also hosted the 2019 World Intellectual Impairment Sport Skiing World Championships, while its 
Maison des Sports caters for many other sports throughout the year, such as tennis, mountain biking and 
hiking. The course used at Grenoble 1968 was opened up to the public as part of the 50th anniversary 
celebrations in 2018.

T R E M PL I N  D U  C L A R E T 
Although the venue has not been used for a major competition since a Nordic Combined World Cup 
event in 1987, it has been expanded, with the creation of two junior hills. All three hills are used today for 
junior training and competitions, and for beginners’ ski jumping classes laid on by the local ski club.

STA D E  D E G L AC E
Today called Palais des Sports - Pierre Mendès France, the 12,000-seat venue hosted several major 
sporting events in the years after the Olympic Winter Games, including the 1972 IAAF European Athletics 
Indoor Championships. Now a popular concert venue, it has staged the Six Jours de Grenoble track 
cycling event since 1971, the Festival International du Cirque since 2002, and the annual Supercross 
motorcycling competition since the 1990s.

PAT I N O I R E  M U N I C I PA L E
Built in 1963, it was initially the home of the city’s ice hockey club but had its ice rink removed in 2001.

This was the venue for several major speed skating competitions after the Games, the last of them the 
1981 World Sprint Championships. Its track refrigeration system was removed in 1990 due to the high 
running costs, at which point the site was adapted for community use. An outdoor venue, it is now used 
by local people for roller skating and jogging, and hosts concerts, festivals and theatre performances. It is 
also a popular gathering place for the city’s residents. Like the Stade de Glace and Patinoire Municipale, it 
is situated in the Parc Paul Mistral. 

G R E N O B L E O LY M PI C V I L L AG E
After the Games, 1,000 of the Village’s apartments were made available as social housing and 300 for 
co-ownership, while 1,800 rooms were set aside for university students, young workers and immigrants. 
Its population has declined from more than 6,200 in 1975 to just over 3,300, partly because of people 
leaving for newer residential areas nearby. Plans for the renovation and renewal of the Village are in place, 
with EUR 191 million to be invested over a 10-year period.

C H A M R O USS E
The resort was remodelled for the Games, with new ski slopes created and six new chairlifts installed. Its 
development has continued since then, thanks to the Grenoble to Chamrousse 2030 project, and it now 
has 41 runs spread over three different levels, from Chamrousse 1650 to Chamrousse 1750. Catering 
for families and skiers of all abilities, it attracts tourists all year round and hosts FIS-ranking events and the 
Stars of Chamrousse, an Alpine ski race for juniors.

P I ST E D E  LU G E
The venue staged only a few international events after the Games and was later used for local 
competitions and youth training. Abandoned in 1994, the site was bought four years later by a French 
Olympic luger, who converted it into a leisure park offering family and recreational activities. The last 
400m of the track are used for luging in the summer months.

This artificial track was built with natural ice at an altitude of 2,000 metres to make the ice easier to 
maintain. It was exposed to sunlight during the day, however. Proving too costly to maintain, the track 
was abandoned shortly after the Games and dismantled in the 1990s. All that remains of the facility is 
the starting house and finish-line house, which have been converted into a restaurant and an equestrian 
centre respectively.

The venue was used for training and competitions until the 1990s, hosting FIS Ski Jumping World Cup 
events in 1980 and 1981. Strong winds made safety an issue, especially with athletes jumping ever higher 
and further. When the FIS introduced new regulations in 1990, the hill was closed and subsequently 
abandoned. It is now in a state of disrepair. Since 2018, the landing area has been used to host an annual 
multi-sports festival that brings together 5,000 people for running, climbing and mountain bike events.

Like the Olympic Village, the Media Centre was built specifically with the idea of providing 
accommodation for students and local residents after the Olympic Winter Games. Situated nearby, it 
comprises seven eight- to 10-storey buildings with 512 apartments. Complete with a gymnasium, cultural 
centre, village hall and shopping centre, it offers both social housing and private apartments. 

To mark the 50th anniversary of these Olympic Winter Games, a giant mural covering an area of 300 
square metres was painted on the side of one of the Media Centre buildings. Based on inputs from local 
residents, it features scenes from the Games, including a portrait of the great French skier Jean-Claude 
Killy, who won three Alpine skiing gold medals at Grenoble 1968.

The Grenoble 1968 Olympic cauldron still stands in the Parc Paul Mistral today.

A stand-alone venue that hosted the men’s large hill competition, the ski jumping hill at Saint-Nizier was 
built in such a way that ski jumpers appeared to be flying over nearby Grenoble when they took off. The 
images caught by the world’s photographers at the Olympic Winter Games helped market the city and 
promote it as the “Capital of the Alps”.

The Olympic ice hockey matches held at the Stade de Glace and the Patinoire Municipale attracted sell-
out crowds and provided a springboard for ice hockey in France. Participation numbers rose after the 
Games and new ice hockey clubs were founded. There are now more than 80 across France.

training centre for Japan’s Ground Self-Defence Force.

Popular with the local community and visitors, the rink remains the centrepiece of Makomanai Park, 
which was the hub of the Games and then opened to the public as a place of recreation and leisure. 
As well as skating, the rink hosts other sports such as karate, handball, tennis, badminton, basketball, 
volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics. It is also a popular conference and concert venue, and welcomes 
PPE classes for school children. The arena has 6,024 permanent seats but can be expanded to a 
capacity of 10,770.

The lower stands of this 17,324-seat venue – which is also located in Makomanai Park – sit below 
ground level, allowing the stadium to blend in with the park’s natural landscape. The stadium has been 
in constant use since the Games – for skating in winter, and for athletics, tennis and futsal during the 
summer. Its gym is open all year round. The venue offers dancing, yoga and physical exercice classes for 
children and adults. 

TS U K I SA M U I N D O O R S K AT I N G R I N K
Used by the local community for gym classes and recreational skating, the venue is the home arena 
of Sapporo Ice Hockey Club, which plays in the J-ICE North League, the second tier of Japanese ice 
hockey. 

M I K A H O I N D O O R S K AT I N G  R I N K
After the Games, the venue was used briefly as a heated swimming pool in the summer months. It now 
operates as an ice rink in winter (for figure skating, recreational skating and curling) and as a gym in 
summer.

O K U R AYA M A  S K I J U M P
Constructed in 1931, the venue was expanded for the 1972 Olympic Winter Games, with the original 
jump being moved forward to help negate crosswinds, and stands being built for 50,000 spectators. 
A new lift was installed in 1982; the hill was expanded to a 115 K-point jump in 1986; and further 
refurbishments were carried out in 1996 and 2018.

A regular FIS Ski Jumping World Cup venue, Okurayama Ski Jump has hosted world and national 
championships and Continental Cup events, and it is also a training site. Popular with tourists, the hill’s 
tower has an observation lounge offering panoramic views of Sapporo, the Ishikari Plain and Ishikari Bay.

M I YA N O M O R I S K I J U M P 
This is located one kilometre south of Okurayama Ski Jump. The design of the hill’s landing slope and 
run-off area take full advantage of the mountain’s natural contours. In 1983, the hill was enlarged to 
become a 90m jump and is now equipped for year-round operation.

The venue hosts competitions on a regular basis, staging FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and Continental 
Cup events, national championships and the annual Sapporo Olympic Memorial Ski Jumping 
competition.

Now known as the Makomanai Gorin Danchi and situated in the southern part of the city, the Olympic

This was an existing resort, still regarded as one of Japan’s best ski destinations and renowned for the 
quality of its snow. Mt Teine has hosted the Alpine skiing events at the Asian Winter Games on three 
occasions as well as the 1991 Winter Universiade. The resort has two ski zones – Highland and Olympia 
– and visitor facilities that include restaurants, ski schools and rental shops. There is also a terrain park for 
snowboarders and freestyle skiers. Mt Teine’s Olympia Ski School was the first in the Hokkaido region to 
be accredited by the Ski Association of Japan, and has produced many excellent skiers.

The tracks were underused after the Games, owing to the lack of an established sliding sports culture 
in Japan. The luge course was closed in 1985, the bobsleigh course in 2000, and the tracks were 
subsequently mostly dismantled. 

The start house of the bobsleigh course was left standing but has since been abandoned.

Some 20 hectares of forest were cut down to make way for the Mount Eniwa courses. After the 1972 
Olympic Winter Games, the courses were removed, as intended, and the site successfully replanted. 

DID YOU K NOW?

Still home to the Olympic cauldron, Makomanai Park contains 63,000 trees and its famous dogtooth 
violets, which bloom every May.

Miyanomori Ski Jump was the setting for one of the most famous events in Japanese Olympic history, 
when its ski jumpers swept all the medals in the normal hill competition.

Sapporo Olympic Museum is located at the foot of the Okurayama Ski Jump. Its attractions include 
displays on the 1972 Olympic Winter Games and a ski jumping simulator.

Mount Eniwa is an active volcano, although it has not erupted since the early 18th century. The original 
plan was to make the downhill courses on its slopes permanent. However, following opposition from the 
public and a nature conservation group,  the local authorities changed their plans.  It become a temporary 
venue on the condition that all facilities be removed afterwards and the area permanently restored to its 
original state.

Nine competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Innsbruck 
1976. All of them had been used at the Olympic Winter Games Innsbruck 1964 
and were refurbished to varying degrees for Innsbruck 1976. They are all still in 
use today. Hosting a large number of sports and competitions,they benefit the 
local population and high-performance athletes alike and also attract visitors to 
the city and region.

All of them were existing sites, though the Olympic Ice Track was rebuilt for 
Innsbruck 1976. Six of the venues hosted Olympic events for a third time at 
the 2012 Winter Youth Olympic Games: Bergisel Ski Jump; the Olympiaworld 
Olympic Ice Track, Outdoor Ice Rink and Olympia Hall; and “Olympiaregion” 
Seefeld and Patscherkofel.

Bergisel Ski Jump staged the Opening Ceremony, and Innsbruck Olympic Ice 
Stadium hosted the Closing Ceremony. Both venues are still in use. An Olympic 
Village was also built for the Games, just to the south of the Olympic Village built 
for Innsbruck 1964.

One of the world’s leading ski jumping venues and a popular tourist attraction. A ski jumping site since 
1927, when a wooden jump was erected, it was upgraded for the 1964 Olympic Winter Games and  
again for Innsbruck 1976. Parts of the Bergisel site are protected by cultural heritage status.

The Bergiselschanze is the venue for the third round of the world-famous annual Four Hills
Tournament, which is held in early January and attracts sell-out crowds of 28,000. The hill also
hosted the ski jumping events at the 1985 and 2019 Nordic World Ski Championships and the
inaugural Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012, when it again staged the Opening Ceremony. 
Formerly a regular stop on the summertime FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix tour, the Bergiselschanze is  
a year-round ski jumping training centre used by Austria’s national ski jumping team, other national
teams from around the world, and three local ski clubs. The venue plays host to other winter sports
such as snowboarding and freestyle skiing. Its spectator area is used as an open-air theatre in the
summer and hosted the Innsbruck Fan Zone at UEFA Euro 2008.

O LY M P I C I C E STA D I U M
Part of the Olympiaworld complex and now known as the Olympiahalle, this multi-sports venue hosts 
ice hockey matches and figure skating events, and hosted matches at the 2010 European Handball 
Championships and the 2011 European Volleyball Championships. It is also used extensively by the  
local community.

Austria’s only outdoor speed-skating rink, the Olympia Eisschnellaufbahn is also part of the city’s 
Olympiaworld complex, which was the Olympic Park at both Innsbruck 1964 and 1976. It is a training 
centre for Austria’s speed skating teams, and is also used for ice skating competitions and recreational 
skating for the general public and schoolchildren. In summer, it is an inline hockey venue, and it also 
stages concerts. It underwent a major refurbishment for Innsbruck 1976.

O LY M P I C C O M B I N E D T R AC K
As part of an extensive refurbishment of the venue in preparation for the Austrian city’s second Olympic 
Winter Games, the separate bobsleigh and luge tracks used at Innsbruck 1964 were removed and 
replaced by a combined, artificially refrigerated track, which remains in place. 

The venue has hosted several world championships – including the 2016 IBSF Bobsleigh and Skeleton 
World Championships – and is a popular tourist attraction in both winter and summer, offering visitors 
Olympic track sliding experiences. Part of the Olympiaworld umbrella brand, the Olympia Eiskanal 
Innsbruck is the training base of the Austrian Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation.

M ES S E H A L L E (I N D O O R S K AT I N G R I N K )
Rebuilt in 2011, Congress Messe Innsbruck hosts major medical conferences and Interalpin, the world’s 
leading trade fair for Alpine technologies. The venue, which has helped make Innsbruck a leading 
business, trade show and conference hub, also organises concerts and art exhibitions.

I N N S B R U C K O LY M PI C V I L L AG E
The 1976 Olympic Village was built to the south of the 1964 Village, which was already housing local 
people by that time. As planned, and as was the case with the 1964 Village, its apartments were made 
available to Innsbruck residents after the Olympic Winter Games ended. Still known locally as the O-Dorf, 
the Olympic Village is currently home to around 7,000 people of over 50 nationalities. It is well served 
by the city’s public transport network, and its amenities include nurseries, schools, sports and cultural 
clubs, health clinics, shops, an indoor swimming pool, and a recently built five-floor nursing home.

PATSC H E R KO F E L
Just as it was in 1964, Patscherkofel was the venue for the men’s downhill at Innsbruck 1976. The resort 
can be reached from Innsbruck by cable car and is a popular weekend retreat for the city’s inhabitants. It 
offers a wide range of winter and summer activities. 

A X A M E R  L I Z U M
Built for the 1964 Olympic Winter Games, Axamer Lizum has since built up a reputation for delivering 
consistently good conditions, and attracts skiers and snowboarders of all ages. One of Austria’s snowiest 
resorts, it is served by 10 cable cars and lifts and has around 40 kilometres of groomed slopes, some of 
which are named after the Olympic races they hosted in 1964. It is also the training centre of the Tyrolean 
Ski Instructors’ Association.

S E E F E L D
Boasting over 250km of cross-country skiing trails, Seefeld continues to attract Nordic sport athletes of  
all ages and abilities and was the venue for 2019 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships.

TO N I S E E LOS S K I J U M P
The Tirol region’s other Olympic ski jumping venue, located in Seefeld, is home to two hills, which are 
used by ski jumpers of all ages and abilities.

In preparation for Innsbruck 1976, the Bergiselschanze became the first hill in the world to be
equipped with a take-off table with a changeable slope.

The current Bergiselschanze was built in 2001 by the late and celebrated architect Zaha Hadid.  
Its award-winning, steel-lined tower comprises a panoramic café and a viewing platform open  
to the public every day. A funicular runs to the tower, carrying visitors 250 metres above the city  
on a two-minute ride.

The Olympic Ice Track is also used for skeleton and staged a round of the 2020/21 IBSF  
Skeleton World Cup.

Built for Innsbruck 1976 and still in use today, the city’s school-teacher training academy was used  
as the press centre during the Games. As planned, the building reverted back to its main function  
after the Games. The University of Innsbruck made use of the academy before it was renamed the
Praxisvolksschule in 2007, when it also became a fully functioning school. Extended in 2012, the
academy provides schooling for several hundred local children.

Seven competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Lake Placid 
1980. They all remain in use, providing first-class facilities for recreational and 
high-performance sport, and welcoming the local community and visitors alike.

Three of the competition venues were existing and renovated for the occasion; 
one of them – the 1932 Jack Shea Arena – was used when Lake Placid hosted 
the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, in 1932. The other four were built for 
the 1980 Games, although three of them featured new facilities built to upgrade 
venues used for the 1932 Games, using the same footprint. 

The Field House International Ice Rink, a competition venue still in use, also 
hosted the Closing Ceremony. The Opening Ceremony was held at a  
standalone temporary venue dismantled after the Games, on the Lake Placid 
Equestrian Stadium ground. 

The Olympic Village built for the Games remains in use, as a prison, as  
planned in the bid.

Renovated for Lake Placid 1980, the Arena, now known as the 1932 Jack Shea Arena, is part of Lake 
Placid’s Olympic Center. This much-used sporting and events hub has recently been extensively 
refurbished in preparation for the 2023 Winter World University Games. A training base for US Olympic 
figure skaters, the Arena hosts many events, such as the Lake Placid Ice Dance Championships.  
It was one of several two-time Olympic venues used for the 2019 International Children’s Winter Games.  
A popular community skating venue where classes and annual camps are laid on for the public, the arena 
is also the setting for concerts, conferences and other public events.

Another venue that forms part of the Olympic Center, the Oval was extensively upgraded for Lake Placid 
1980, with a new artificial refrigeration system installed. Though it has not hosted a major international ice-
sport event since 1990, it regularly stages local, regional and national speed skating events. An outdoor 
facility, it is used widely by local schools, speed skating clubs and the local community for recreational 
skating, speed skating and ice hockey. It was also a venue for the 2019 International Children’s Winter 
Games. As part of the Olympic Center’s refurbishment, the Oval has had a new refrigeration system 
installed, among other upgrades designed to ensure compliance with international competition 
standards.

The fourth of Lake Placid’s two-time Olympic venues, the jumps used in 1932 were replaced 
by new ones for the resort’s second Olympic Winter Games. A year-round competition and 
training venue, the complex boasts K-120 and K-90 ski jump towers and two training hills, and it has 
hosted a variety of international ski jumping events over the years, including events at the 2019 
International Children’s Winter Games. Its training facilities are used by the US ski team’s 
Elite Aerial Development Program (EADP).

A much-used ice hockey venue and the setting for the so-called “Miracle on Ice”, the USA’s dramatic  
4-3 win over the USSR in the medal round of the men’s competition at Lake Placid 1980. To mark the  
25th  anniversary of the match in 2005, the venue was renamed the 1980 Herb Brooks Arena in honour  
of the USA’s coach that day. All 19 members of that US team, which went on to win the gold medal, 
reunited for the occasion and continue to come together for the Miracle on Ice Fantasy Camp. Another 
Olympic Center venue, the arena has been refurbished in preparation for the 2023 Winter World

Federal funding for the construction of the 937-room Olympic Village was provided on condition that there 
would be a practical use for the facility after the Games were over. Despite local opposition, it  
was decided that it would become a prison. Though some delegations chose to accommodate their 
athletes in rented houses instead, the Olympic Village was mostly full at Games time. Six months later, 
it became the Ray Brook Federal Corrections Institution, which continues to operate today and houses 
1,000 inmates.

The complex’s 56 kilometres of separate cross-country and biathlon trails, which were built for the 1980 
Olympic Winter Games and offer approximately 150 days of skiing a year, were recently replaced by a 
new, combined system of trails. Regularly groomed and patrolled, these trails are used by cross-country 
skiers of all abilities and also host annual events such as the Lake Placid Loppet and the Empire State

The venue has undergone many changes since the construction of the original, natural bobsleigh track 
for Lake Placid 1932. In preparation for Lake Placid 1980, the bobsleigh track was replaced by a new one 
and a separate luge track was built. In 2000, both tracks were replaced by a combined bobsleigh, luge 
and skeleton track. The centre forms part of the Mount Van Hoevenberg Sports Complex and is listed in 
the American National Register of Historic Places. 

It regularly stages luge, bobsled and skeleton World Cup events. It hosted the IBSF World 
Championships for a ninth time in 2012, and the FIL World Luge Championships for the second time in 
2009. USA Luge is headquartered in Lake Placid and uses the sliding track as its home training track. The 
centre is also home to the Lake Placid Bobsled Experience, which gives visitors the chance to ride down 
the track. 

W H I T E FAC E M O U N TA I N
Only minor upgrades were needed to prepare the slopes of Whiteface Mountain for the 1980 Winter 
Games. Recent improvements have been made, however, with new snowmaking systems and the 
recent opening of a new Legacy Lodge. The venue attracts thousands of tourists from New York state 
and further afield every year.

The 1980 Herb Brooks Arena owes its status as a special place of pilgrimage for US ice hockey fans to
the Miracle on Ice, a match that was so called because the USA’s team of amateur players were not 
expected to beat the stars of the USSR team, the tournament favourites.

The 1980 Herb Brooks Arena staged the entire regular 2020/21 National Women’s Hockey League
season in early 2021, with the six competing teams isolating in a bubble due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Mt Van Hoevenberg Sliding Center will host the IBSF World Championships for a 10th time in 2025.

A total of 106 Olympic skating records were broken on the James B. Sheffield Speed Skating Oval’s 
new 400-metre refrigerated track at the 1980 Games, with the USA’s Eric Heiden winning a record five 
individual gold medals there.

Built for Lake Placid 1980 as an ice hockey and figure skating training venue, the Olympic Center - USA 
Rink remains in use today, as a practice rink hosting public skating sessions. It was known at Games time 
as the Field House US Ice Rink.

The Lussi Rink was another ice hockey and figure skating training venue built especially for Lake Placid 
1980 that remains in use today. The rink has been dismantled, and the building is now the Olympic 
Center Convention facility.

Eight competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Sarajevo 
1984. Six of them are still in use today, benefitting the local community, visitors 
and recreational and high-performance athletes alike. One of the competition 
venues was an existing site. The rest were built for the Games. The Olympic 
venues suffered damage to varying degrees during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 
1995. Most have been restored to their original use and modernised since then, 
partly thanks to international support. Visitors and local residents continue to use 
them for a wide range of winter and summer sports.

Although the ski jumps and sliding track can no longer be used for winter 
sports, the sites where they are located host a wide variety of other sporting 
and cultural activities. For example, the reopening, in 2018, of the cable car 
connecting the city to the top of Mount Trebević has allowed more people to 
access the area for hiking and other pursuits. Since then, the number of hotels, 
restaurants, recreation centres, etc. has grown alongside the number of visitors.

An existing venue, Koševo Stadium, hosted the Opening Ceremony. 
It continues to be used as a venue for track and field, football and rugby. The 
Olympic Hall of the newly built Zetra Complex staged the Closing Ceremony.
 A multi-purpose facility, it is used for sports and other events. 

An Olympic Village was built for the Games, in the Mojmilo district. It was 
renovated after the war and is fully occupied today.

The facility suffered heavy damage during the Bosnian War. It underwent restoration work in 1999 and 
2017. Reconstructed after the war, the venue is now used for winter and summertime training, community 
and public recreational sports, and festivals. A small, covered ice rink and artificial football pitch have also 
been installed in the centre of the rink.

Z E T R A C O M P L E X -  O LY M PI C H A L L
This was renamed the Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic Hall in 2010, following the death of the former 
IOC President, who was instrumental in the IOC’s support for the rebuilding of the venue after it was 
shelled and extensively damaged during the Bosnian War. 

It is the home of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s national handball, futsal and ice hockey teams, its National 
Olympic Committee and the ZOI’84 Olympic Legacy Foundation. Up to 17 different sports are played 
there. Used widely by the local community, its facilities include tennis courts, outdoor basketball and 
football pitches, indoor and outdoor ice rinks, a billiard sports hall, bowling alley, pistol range and a gym.

Also a venue for concerts, trade shows and conferences, it hosted the ice hockey competition 
of the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival and staged the 2018 European Cadet Judo 
Championships.

This is the biggest stadium in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a capacity of 35,000. Damaged during the 
Bosnian War, it was renovated in 1996 with the help of the IAAF and the IOC to host the “IAAF Sarajevo 
1996 Athletics Meeting of Solidarity”. Further upgrades were done in preparation for a visit by Pope 
John Paul II in April 1997 and a U2 concert later that year, two symbolically important events in the city’s 
recovery from the war.

It is the home of football team Sarajevo FK and the country’s national team. It also plays host to local and 
national track and field, football and rugby events. The venue is currently awaiting refurbishment to bring it 
into line with UEFA’s latest stadium access requirements. It was renamed after the famous football player 
Asim Ferhatović Hase.

In 2019, Sarajevo and East Sarajevo successfully hosted the 14th Winter European Youth Olympic 
Festival. The Opening Ceremony was held at the stadium with the attendance of 38,000 people, 
celebrating the revival of the Olympic Spirit.

M O J M I LO O LY M PI C V I L L AG E
Located in the Mojmilo district of Sarajevo, the Village’s 639 apartments were made available after the 
Games to families in need of permanent accommodation. Though extensively damaged during the 
Bosnian War, the Olympic Village was renovated afterwards, and is fully occupied today. The central 
plaza of the Olympic Village in Mojmilo was renamed Barcelona Square in honour of the Spanish city, 
which helped rebuild the Village after the Bosnian War. The two cities twinned in 2000, a year after 
rebuilding work was completed.

This is a modern ski resort that attracts 20,000 to 30,000 people a day during the winter. Its facilities 
include eight lifts and seven runs offering 12.5km of skiing. Two of these runs were homologated by the 
FIS for use at the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival. Bjelašnica has also hosted FIS Europa 
Cup snowboard events. Having undergone continual development since 2000, the resort also boasts 
several hotels, apartment complexes and restaurants, as well as a newly installed snow-making system 
complete with two lakes.

JA H O R I N A
This is the largest and most popular ski resort in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 25km of slopes. Its eight 
FIS-homologated runs include the three Olympic runs and are used by elite skiers for training. They also 
host international competitions, such as the FIS Cup Jahorina, last held in 2019. The resort has a new 
snow-making system and extensive facilities for visitors, including restaurants, bars, clubs and hotels. It 
suffered no damage during the Bosnian War.

Situated on Mount Trebević, the track was used as an artillery position during the Bosnian War. Mount 
Trebević was a feared place during the 1,425-day siege of Sarajevo, offering clear vantage points for 
attacking the city below. The mountain was declared a national park in 2014 and reopened to the public 
in 2017, following more than 15 years of work to clear its slopes of abandoned military hardware and the 
thousands of mines laid during the war.

The graffiti-covered bobsleigh and luge track on Mount Trebević has become one of Sarajevo’s cultural 
landmarks, and attracts lovers of street art from all over the world.

With the aid of volunteers, the national bobsleigh federation and a grant from the International Luge 
Federation, the ZOI’84 Olympic Legacy Foundation began restoration work on the badly damaged track 
in 2014. Though it remains unfit for official sliding sports competitions, it is used for extreme cycling and as 
a summer luge training venue. 

I G M A N O LY M PI C J U M P S
Igman Malo Polje was once home to five ski jumps (three wooden and two concrete), and hosted its last 
competition in 1988. Heavy fighting during the Bosnian War caused the destruction of the wooden jumps 
and extensive damage to the concrete ones.

Although Igman Malo Polje’s two surviving ski jumps are no longer in use, the facilities around them have  
been redeveloped and welcome families in both summer and winter. They include a fully functioning 
restaurant and a small ski lift and slope used for beginners’ ski classes, while the run-off area is now 
occupied by a playground.

DID YOU K NOW?

Symbols of Sarajevo’s Olympic identity, the venues used at the XIV Olympic Winter Games were 
repeatedly targeted during the Bosnian War, when the city was besieged for nearly four years. Their 
subsequent reconstruction reflected Sarajevo’s pride in its Olympic heritage and its status as the only 
Olympic host city in this part of Europe. 

Zetra Olympic Hall housed Sarajevo’s Olympic Museum on a temporary basis for 16 years before it 
returned to its original location across the city in October 2020.

Six of the city’s Olympic venues staged events during the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival, 
which was jointly hosted by Sarajevo and the neighbouring city of East Sarajevo. 

Hotel Igman housed reporters and competitors in the cross-country, Nordic combined and biathlon 
events. It too was bombed during the war and remains in ruins.

More than 20,000 people use the Calgary Olympic Oval every year for skating, while over 1,000 athletes 
from 22 countries trained there in the 2018-19 season.

The Oval staged an event on the 2019/20 ISU Speed Skating World Cup circuit, and has hosted both the 
World Allround Championships and World Sprint Championships five times, most recently in 2019 and 
2017 respectively.

It is used by the university’s sports teams and the Calgary X-Tremes, the city’s women’s ice hockey 
team. The Oval is also Speed Skating Canada’s official training centre and the home of the country’s Elite 
Athlete Pathway, a blueprint for the development of young speed skaters.

For the two months of the year when it is not staging ice events, the Oval is a multi-purpose venue
that plays host to car shows, science fairs, the Canadian judo and taekwondo championships, and
volleyball, gymnastics, floor hockey, running and billiards events.

Calgary’s main indoor arena, the Saddledome is the home stadium of the Calgary Flames, which plays 
in the NHL; the Calgary Hitmen, a junior ice hockey team; and professional lacrosse team the Calgary

stadium was quickly repaired. The Saddledome owes its name to the fact that its roof is the shape of a 
horse’s saddle.

Comprising 226 apartments, two new halls of residence were built on the campus of the University of

The park’s ski jumps were used by a local ski club and were the main training hub for Canada’s

Another of Calgary’s ice hockey arenas and a frequent venue for Canada’s Davis Cup team, the Corral

Temporary accommodation and services (e.g. a kitchen and offices) were provided for 578 people at a

new swimming pool and a new clubhouse were built as well as the accommodation. These facilities are 
still in use by the local community.

The Olympic Oval quickly became known among speed skaters as having “the fastest ice in the world”. 
Six of the ten distance world records were broken here at Calgary 1988, and over 300 world long- and 
short-track speed skating records have been set at the venue since then.

At the last three Olympic Winter Games (Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018), some 
61 of Canada’s 80 medals were won by athletes who had trained or competed at Calgary’s snow and ice 
sports venues, including those used for the 1988 Olympic Winter Games. 

Canada Olympic Park, the site of three of the Calgary 1988 venues, welcomes more than 1.2 million 
visitors annually. 

The Lincoln Park Media Village housed the international print media, technical support personnel and 
other members of the Olympic family. Its 500 units were pre-sold to two local mortgage and housing 
corporations, and were made available to buyers on the open market after the Games.

One of several facilities at Albertville’s Henri Dujol Olympic Park, it remains open to the public. The Halle 
Olympique is a training base for the French ice hockey and short track teams. A multi-purpose facility 
with a capacity of between 6,500 and 9,000, it was the venue for the French Short Track Speed Skating 
Championships in 2010, the 2018 Davis Cup tie between France and the Netherlands, and several 
matches at the 2017 World Handball Championship. A key venue for business, art and cultural events, 
it is also the home of the Tremplin 92 – Montagne et Olympisme, which houses a permanent exhibition 
telling the story of the 1992 Games.

A L B E RT V I L L E O LY M PI C OVA L
Also located at Henri Dujol Olympic Park in Albertville, the venue’s temporary ice sheet was removed after 
the Games, and the facility was converted into a 10,000-capacity multi-purpose stadium. It is used by the 
town’s athletics, rugby and football clubs and also hosts occasional rock concerts.

France’s national sliding sports training centre hosts international competitions nearly every year, 
including a round of the 2020 IBSF Bobsleigh World Cup. As planned when it was built, the venue is 
also open to the general public for beginners’ bobsleigh and luge activities. It is visited by approximately 
14,000 people a year. La Plagne, the resort where the sliding track is located, is the world’s most- 
frequented ski resort. In 2003, the sliding centre in La Plagne became the first in the world to switch  
from ammonia to safer glycol refrigeration piping.

Tignes ski resort greatly benefitted from the worldwide exposure provided by the Games. It has gone on 
to become a mecca of freestyle skiing. As well as staging the finals of the FIS Freestyle Skiing Halfpipe 
World Cup between 2015 and 2018, it also hosted the first four editions of the Winter X Games Europe, 
from 2010 to 2013.

Les Ménuires resort has made the most of its Games-inspired transformation from a budget-conscious  
destination to one offering more luxurious accommodation. Its Olympic slalom course is just one  
of its many attractions.

Situated in the heart of the Trois Vallées ski area, the resort opened up the courses used for the women’s 
Alpine skiing events to competitive and recreational skiers after the Games. Its Olympic Park, the ice  
rink of which hosted the men’s ice hockey competition, is now home to a swimming pool, spa, gym  
and meeting rooms.

One of the world’s best-known ski resorts, it staged the men’s Alpine combined, downhill, giant slalom 
and super giant slalom events. The venue for the 2009 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, Val d’Isère 
also hosts an event on the annual Alpine Ski World Cup tour. Having gradually developed its infrastructure 
over the years, it now offers 25,000 hotel beds for visitors.

Les Saisies resort’s Nordic ski area   has 120 kilometres of trails. They cater for every skill level and are a 
regular venue for national and international competitions, including the Biathlon and Cross-Country Skiing 
World Cups.

This Nordic skiing centre offers three different loops for recreational cross-country skiers: 1.5km, 7km 
and 8.5km. The smallest loop is designed for beginners, while the others are used by more advanced 
skiers.

The Cross-Country Stadium is a national ski jumping hub and is used as a national team training centre  
by France and other countries. Its hills host the only French round of the summertime FIS Ski Jumping 
Grand Prix, which brings together the world’s leading jumpers in mid-August and attracts thousands  
of spectators.

A leisure centre complete with a swimming pool, bowling alley, spa, ice rink, and a multi-sports hall with 
a climbing wall and courts for basketball, badminton, volleyball and other sports. The centre also has an 
outdoor recreational area with a mini-golf course and bouncy castles. The ice rink stages ice hockey 
matches and figure skating galas, among other events.

Situated in the spa resort of Brides-Les-Bains, some 32 kilometres from Albertville, the Village comprised 
seven existing hotels that were refurbished to accommodate most of the athletes. The hotels remain in 
use today. The remaining athletes were housed in hotels and guest houses in Les Saisies, Val d’Isère, La 
Plagne, La Tania and Tignes.

The slope was left to disappear naturally after the Games. A number of deaths were recorded in speed

of being too dangerous.

Located in Albertville’s Henri Dujol Olympic Park, it hosted the Opening and Closing 
Ceremonies. Regarded at the time as the largest temporary structure ever built, it had a capacity  
of 35,000 and was taken down as planned as soon as the Games were over. A model for subsequent 
temporary venues, it is now an urban park. All that remains of the original construction is the 52-metre- 
tall flagpole that once stood at its centre and was a distinctive feature of the Albertville 1992 ceremonies.

The ski resorts that staged events at Albertville 1992 form part of a network of 110 resorts in the Savoie 
Mont Blanc region, making it France’s leading winter sports destination. Covering two-thirds of the French 
Alps, the region welcomes millions of visitors every year. 

Among the many exhibits offered by the Tremplin 92 – Montagne et Olympisme is a virtual descent of the 
bobsleigh run in La Plagne, complete with VR headsets. 

The Albertville 1992 venues are increasingly environmentally aware. Val d’Isère has installed a vast, state-
of-the-art underground snow-creation facility at the foot of the Bellevarde slope, greatly reducing power 
usage. Meanwhile, Les Saisies has swapped snow cannons for snowfarming to preserve snow, which is 
piled up and covered with sawdust to prevent it from melting during the summer and then spread back on 
to the slopes come winter.

Originally known as the Albertville Olympic Park, Henri Dujol Olympic Park was renamed in 2006 in 
honour of a former mayor who championed the town’s modernisation for the Games.

Ten competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games 
Lillehammer 1994. All of them remain in use today, staging world, European 
and national championships and a host of other sporting events, and 
contributing to the development of a vibrant grassroots sports culture in the 
region. One of the competition venues was an existing site. The rest were built 
for the Games.

The Opening and Closing Ceremonies were held at the ski jumping venue.

Two Olympic Villages were used at the Games: a main one in Lillehammer and 
a smaller one at an existing site in Hamar. Both are still in use today.

A 12,500-capacity multi-purpose venue used for sport, recreation and culture. Its ice hockey rink, 
which staged matches at the 1999 IIHF World Championships, can be converted into four handball 
or futsal courts, six volleyball courts or eight badminton courts. The hall hosted matches at the 2008 
European Men’s Handball Championships, and also has an indoor golf centre with two golf simulators, 
a fitness centre and an indoor running track. A venue for events as diverse as the 2004 Junior Eurovision 
Song Contest and the 2018 World Logging Championship, it has staged numerous concerts and 
comedy shows, and is also used as a conference centre. It is one of five Olympic venues located at 
Lillehammer Olympiapark. Birkebeineren Ski and Biathlon Stadium, Lysgårdsbakkene Ski Jumping 
Arena, the Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track, and the Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena are the

Home to both a large and a small hill, the venue was refurbished in 2007, when plastic matting was 
installed to enable year-round training and jumping. It is one of three national ski jumping training centres 
in Norway and has been the venue for several international competitions, including the FIS Ski Jump 
World Cup and ‘Raw Air’, a FIS Ski Jumping World Cup event. Around 100,000 jumps are made on the 
two hills every year.

B I R K E B E I N E R E N  S K I  STA D I U M
The venue’s 27km of cross-country trails and 9km of biathlon trails are still used extensively, and have 
hosted several FIS Cross-Country World Cup, Biathlon World Cup and Nordic Combined World Cup 
events. During the summer, they are popular with walkers, joggers, mountain bikers and roller skiers.

K A N T H AU G E N F R E EST Y L E  A R E N A
Its three hills – one each for aerials, moguls and ski ballet – were laid out in such a way as to minimise 
damage to the surrounding forest. The arena hosted the FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup in 1993 and 
1995. It has not hosted any freestyle skiing activities since then, but tobogganing and alpine skiing for 
kids are just some of the other popular pursuits that the arena offers.

GJ Ø V I K O LY M P I C  CAV E R N H A L L
The venue was built inside a mountain to ensure stable year-round temperatures and keep energy costs 
low. Open to the public most days of the year, its ice rink staged the 1995 World Short Track Speed 
Skating Championships and was the venue for the short track speed skating events at the Winter Youth 
Olympic Games Lillehammer 2016. The hall also hosted matches at the 1999 European Women’s 
Handball Championships.

This 10,600-capacity venue is Norway’s national arena for bandy (an 11-a-side version of ice hockey 
that uses a ball instead of a puck) and speed skating. It hosted the ISU Speed Skating World Cup as 
recently as 2019. Known locally as “the Viking Ship”, Hamar Olympic Hall is a multi-purpose venue that 
accommodates football, cycling, athletics, curling, motorsports and equestrian sports. It also has a golf 
driving range. Among other events, it stages skating shows and competitions, trade shows, exhibitions 
and concerts, with both Beyoncé and Stevie Wonder having performed there.

Comprising temporary and permanent housing, the Lillehammer Olympic Village housed around 2,300 
athletes and officials during the 1994 Olympic Winter Games. Some 185 houses remained on the site

This existing site at Toneheim District College is a folk high school specialising in music. It accommodated

DID YOU K NOW?

Between the end of the 1994 Olympic Winter Games and the summer of 2018, Lillehammer’s 10 Olympic 
venues staged 32 World and European Championships and international tournaments, 129 World Cup 
events and 161 national cup events.

Nine of the 1994 Olympic Winter Games competition venues were used for competitions and education 
programmes at the Winter Youth Olympic Games Lillehammer 2016.

The five Olympic venues at Lillehammer Olympiapark and Gjøvik Olympic Mountain Hall have all been 
certified by Eco-Lighthouse, Norway’s most widely used environmental management system.

Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall, which hosted ice hockey, is the world’s largest underground auditorium. It is 
positioned 120 metres inside a mountain, with around 55 metres of bedrock above it.

Home to the world’s media at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) 
was taken over afterwards by Lillehammer’s Oppland College. As a result, the College increased the 
size of its campus, student body and number of courses offered. In 2017, the College merged with the 
Inland Norway (INN) University of Applied Sciences. Thanks to the collaboration between INN University, 
the Lillehammer Olympic and Paralympic Studies Centre (LOSC) and the Norwegian Olympic Museum, 
Lillehammer has become a key centre for Olympic studies and research.

The venue for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies is now known as Nagano Olympic Stadium. Now 
converted into a baseball stadium, the venue is used by local amateur clubs and a professional team,
the Shinano Grandserows. It is also the finishing point for the annual Nagano Commemorative Marathon.

Comprising 1,032 apartments and located in the Imai district of Nagano, it was designed to provide

Although its shooting range was dismantled after the Games, the course remains open. Its cross-country

The areas already welcomed snow sports enthusiasts before the Games. Though the temporary Games 
infrastructures were dismantled as planned after the Games, the slopes continued to be used for skiing 
and snowboarding again the following years, as the Shiga Kogen resorts complex developed and grew. 
Offering more than 80km of slopes and some of the country’s finest snow, the 18 Shiga Kogen ski resorts 
now make up Japan’s largest interconnected ski area.

Housed at the M-Wave, the Nagano Olympic Museum is one of 28 Olympic museums around the world.

The M-Wave was awarded the UK-based Institution of Structural Engineers’ special award for structural 
engineering excellence in February 1998.

The Spiral was the first bobsleigh/luge track in the world to feature two uphill sections.

A common feature of the new venues used at Nagano 1998 was their unique architectural designs. The 
Big Hat is so called because of its distinctive shape, while the flowing lines of the Aqua Wing  resemble a 
bird’s wing, and the White Ring evokes a droplet of water. Minami Nagano Sports Park was modelled on 
Japan’s national flower, the sakura (cherry blossom).

To keep costs down, the Organising Committee furnished rooms at the Olympic Village by renting 
or buying furniture used at other events, including the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima and the 1995 
Summer Universiade in Fukuoka.

Ten competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Salt 
Lake City 2002. All of them are still in use today and offer physical exercise 
and healthy lifestyle activities for the local community, recreational events 
and camps for locals and visitors, and high-performance development 
programmes for US and international athletes at both junior and senior level. 
Six of the competition venues were existing sites. The remaining four were 
built for the Games.

Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium, which hosted the Opening and Closing 
Ceremonies, was a new, non-competition venue, as the stadium was almost 
completely demolished and rebuilt for the Games. The Olympic Village was 
located at an existing site, part of which was restored and part of which was 
given over to the construction of new accommodation. Both the Olympic

With the announcement that Salt Lake City would host the Olympic Winter Games 2002, the city, along 
with the University of Utah, decided to demolish the old stadium almost entirely (although the end zone 
stands remained), and a new stadium rose in its place to host the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of 
the Games. From 2005 to 2008, it was the home of Major League Soccer team Real Salt Lake. Owned 
and run by the University of Utah, the stadium is home to the University of Utah Utes collegiate American 
football team. The stadium also hosts supercross and action sports events, as well as concerts. Both U2

other major events, it has hosted the 2008 European Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships, the 2009 
European Athletics Indoor Championships, the 2013 World Masters Games and the 2014 UEFA Europa 
League final.

Sestriere was one of the world’s first purpose-built ski areas. Its two distinctive hotel towers were built 
in the 1930s by Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli as a holiday retreat for his factory employees in Turin. The 
village is also home to Europe’s highest golf course.

Built in 1995, this 18,000-capacity venue is the home of the city’s NHL team, the Vancouver Canucks, 
and the Vancouver Warriors of the National Lacrosse League. It continues to stage a large number of 
sporting and cultural events throughout the year.

Used year-round, this multi-use facility venue caters for the University of British Columbia’s athletes 
and the wider community, as originally planned when it was built for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. 
The venue is the home of the UBC Thunderbirds women’s and men’s ice hockey teams, among other 
university teams and athletes. A venue for several Davis Cup ties, it hosts concerts, conventions, talks, 
film shoots and ice hockey programmes.

The home of the Western Hockey League’s Vancouver Giants between 2001 and 2016, the Coliseum 
is a much-used venue for concerts and other cultural and sporting events, including ice shows, boxing 
bouts, basketball matches, circuses and trade shows. Built in 1968, the venue underwent a major 
upgrade for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, with new lighting, seats and a scoreboard installed.

Built for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, its 1,000 living units housed over 2,800 athletes, coaches and 
officials and were sold off as private homes after the Games. The units make use of innovative energy 
efficiency and sustainability systems, such as solar heating and green roofs. The Village is located in the 
False Creek area, now well known for its cutting-edge businesses, restaurants and green spaces.

CY PR ESS M O U N TA I N 
The Olympic aerials competition venue still exists, at the foot of the ski area. Next to it is the moguls run, 
which is now known as Alexandre Bilodeau’s Gold, after the Canadian freestyle skier who won the event 
at Vancouver 2010. The resort, which is also home to 53 Alpine ski runs and 19 kilometres of cross-
country trails, runs freestyle camps for youngsters, teaching them terrain park and free-skiing/free-riding 
skills, jumps and tricks.

The slope that hosted the 1,135-metre snowboard and ski cross runs still exists. The snowboard cross, 
parallel giant slalom and ski cross runs have all been renamed after the Canadian women boarders 
and skiers who won gold medals on them at Vancouver 2010: respectively Maëlle Ricker, Jasey-Jay 
Anderson and Ashleigh McIvor. Part of the stadium infrastructures were temporary, however, and were 
taken down, as planned, after the Games, including the half-pipe.

R I C H M O N D O LY M PI C OVA L
As planned, the venue was converted after the Games into a multi-purpose hub of sport, fitness and 
wellness for the community. Used by local residents and high-performance athletes, its facilities include 
two Olympic-sized ice sheets, six hardwood courts, seven multi-use courts, a 200-metre running track, 
an indoor climbing wall, a fitness centre, five fitness and personal training studios, an indoor rowing and 
paddling centre and the Richmond Olympic Experience (part of the Olympic Museums Network). The 
venue is the official training centre for Volleyball Canada’s national women’s team, Table Tennis Canada, 
Speed Skating Canada, Climbing Escalade International and Wheelchair Rugby Canada. The Richmond 
Olympic Oval is also an international sporting venue and has staged the FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix, 
North American Cup Climbing Series, Judo Pacific International and Fencing World Cup events.

Whistler Olympic Park has nearly 90 kilometres of cross-country trails for skiers of all abilities, including 
high-performance junior cross-country athletes. It hosts a number of national, provincial, regional 
and club cross-country skiing competitions, including the BC Winter Games Trial, the Haywood 
Western Canada Cup and the Coast Outdoors Payak. The park caters for recreational skiers too and 
offers introductions to cross-country skiing. Whistler Olympic Park also includes a biathlon shooting 
range. It offers biathlon lessons led by experienced instructors and is the home of the Whistler Nordic 
Development Center, nine of whose young biathletes represented Canada in the 2019/20 season. It also 
stages a number of biathlon competitions.

The Whistler Olympic Park Ski Jumps hosted the FIS Continental Cup women’s ski jumping and men’s 
and women’s Nordic combined competitions in March 2022. The ski jumps are used for youth training 
and camps. Following the closure of the Calgary Ski Jumps and Ski Jumping Canada’s decision not to 
relocate to Whistler for the time being, the site’s owner, Whistler Sport Legacies, is contemplating the 
long-term future of the facility.

W H I ST L E R S L I D I N G C E N T E R
A national training centre for luge, bobsleigh and skeleton, the venue has staged a number of international 
competitions, including FIL Luge World Cup events and the IBSF Bobsleigh and Skeleton World 
Championships. It is also home to the BC Sliding Development Center, which was founded in 2017 and 
runs development programmes for bobsleigh, skeleton and luge athletes of all abilities. The venue is 
also open to the general public all year round, allowing people to experience the three sports in a safe, 
controlled environment.

The village provided accommodation for 2,850 people during the Games. Afterwards, temporary 
accommodation from the Village was sent to six communities in British Columbia to provide 156 
permanent, affordable homes for elderly, homeless and low-income residents, while 300 of the Village’s 
sustainably built homes were made available to local residents. Another part of the Village was converted 
into the Whistler Athletes’ Center, which offers short- and long-term accommodation for coaches, 
athletes and sports staff, as well as state-of-the-art strength and conditioning facilities.

With over one million visitors annually, the Richmond Olympic Oval was the third-busiest tourist attraction 
in British Columbia in 2017.

The Richmond Olympic Oval is home to the Richmond Olympic Experience, which opened in 2015
and is an official member of the IOC’s Olympic Museums Network. 

BC Place Stadium was the first in Canada to be fitted with a roof.

The Olympic Winter Games Vancouver 2010 venues and villages were sustainably built. In 2010, 
they were recognised by the Canada Green Building Council and BC Hydro as the largest group of 
simultaneously constructed, low-environmental-impact facilities in North America. As well as consuming 
less energy and water than other buildings, they required fewer construction materials, minimising waste, 
emissions and use of toxic materials.

The venue has a large hill and a normal hill, as well as three smaller training hills. The main training facility 
for the Republic of Korea’s national ski jumping teams, it hosts local competitions and youth camps, but 
has not staged any major international competitions since the Olympic Winter Games. A year-round 
training centre, it is one of several PyeongChang 2018 venues used for the 2020 Dream Programme, 
which promoted the global growth of winter sports and sought to develop the skills of young athletes from 
Asian countries with few or no winter sports facilities.

A L P E N S I A C R OSS- C O U N T RY C E N T R E
Also a 2020 Dream Programme venue, the Centre is used by cross-country skiers for training during the 
winter, and also hosts youth sports camps. Built in 1995, it staged the cross-country skiing events at the 
1999 Asian Winter Games. It backs onto the Biathlon Centre and the Ski Jumping Stadium.

Another 2020 Dream Programme venue, it is used by biathletes for training during the winter, and

Winter Games.

The Arena, which has a capacity of 12,000, underwent renovation work after the Games and reopened 
as a public multi-sports facility. A swimming pool and an Olympic Museum are being built beside the 
venue. The training facility attached to it is used by Yeongdong College for exhibitions and seminars.

G A N G N EU N G H O C K E Y C E N T R E
The venue for the 2020 IIHF Ice Hockey U20 World Championship Division II Group B, the Centre also 
staged the 2018 Korean National Men’s Ice Hockey Championships and the Legacy Cup, which is held 
yearly to mark the anniversary of the PyeongChang 2018 Games. The Cup has featured teams from 
Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia and the Republic of Korea.

The Centre was the setting for the three-day competition that brought to an end the Girls’ Ice Hockey 
School initiative, a government programme designed to encourage more girls to play winter sports in the 
Republic of Korea, and which also focused on Olympic values and leadership and raised awareness of 
sexual harassment and safeguarding.

country through training and small-sided games, and to improve disability awareness through Para ice-
hockey experiences. 

Though the original plan was to dismantle the Centre after the Games, the City of Gangneung decided to 
maintain it as part of its plans to create a winter sports hub.

Another youth camp and 2020 Dream Programme venue, the Centre staged the Korean National Curling

Curling Championships.

Both villages were converted into residential areas after the Games, as planned. The PyeongChang 
village comprises eight 15-storey buildings that are home to 600 units. The Gangneung village’s nine 
25-storey buildings boast 922 apartments and can accommodate 2,717 people.

The 8,000-seater venue was out of use for over a year after the 2018 Olympic Winter Games due to 
issues surrounding its management and legacy. When sport activities resumed in late 2019, they were 
quickly put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the owner and operator to alter their plans. The 
venue has occasionally been used as a film studio and ice sports experience centre for the Bandabi 
Sports Camp.

The venue was due to be dismantled in line with the initial plan to return the site to its original state and 
remained closed after the Games.

The venue used for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies was mostly temporary, and was dismantled as 
planned after the Games. Only one side of the pentagon-shape stadium was a permanent structure and 
remains in use today, as it currently hosts the PyeongChang Olympic and Paralympic Museum and the 
offices of the PyeongChang 2018 Legacy Foundation.

The rest of the site is being transformed  into the “Peace Park”, a community sports complex that is home 
to an artificial football pitch, an athletics track, and basketball and tennis courts.

The 10,000-capacity Gangneung Hockey Centre is the first and only stadium in the Republic of Korea to 
be built specifically for ice hockey. Originally an archery range, it is located on a former landfill site.

A roofless five-sided venue, PyeongChang Olympic Stadium had a capacity of 35,000 and a floor area of 
58,790 m². It hosted five events before being dismantled: the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of both 
the 2018 Olympic Winter Games and Paralympic Winter Games, and a K-pop concert held 100 days 
before the Olympic Winter Games began.

Gangneung Ice Arena was the largest of all the venues used at PyeongChang 2018. It has a capacity
of 12,000 and two ice rinks: one for competition and one for training.

CR I T ER I A FO R R EGU L A R USE

The criteria used to evaluate whether a venue is used regularly are explained through the decision tree 
below. 

These criteria were developed through discussions with academics, venue operators and venue owners. 
The starting point was Preuss, H., Solberg, H.A. and Alm, J. (2014). A first version of the criteria was 
tested in a pilot study of the Olympic Stadia in 2018 and expanded to other types of venues based on 
discussions with venue operators.

Independent limited assurance report on Selected Indicators 
of the post-Games use of Olympic venues inventory of 
International Olympic Committee 

To the International Olympic Committee management 

We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the International Olympic Committee’s (hereinafter "IOC”)   
selected indicators, namely “number of venues”, “typology” and “current use status”, published in the IOC’s report 
”Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games use” for the period from 1896 to 2018 (the “Selected Indicators”). 

Our assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information 
included in the IOC’s report ”Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games use” or linked to other Information, 
including any images, audio files or embedded videos. 

Our Limited Assurance Conclusion 

Based on the procedures we have performed as described under the ‘Summary of the work we performed as the 
basis for our assurance conclusion’ and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that IOC’s Selected Indicators are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
“methodology on post-Games use of Olympic venues inventory” as described in the IOC’s report ”Over 125 years of 
Olympic venues: post-Games use” on pages 6,7, and 8. 

We do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information 
included in the in the IOC’s report ”Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games use” or linked to other Information, 
including any images, audio files or embedded videos. 

Understanding how the IOC has Prepared the Selected Indicators 

The “methodology on post-Games use of Olympic venues inventory” as described in the IOC’s report ”Over 125 
years of Olympic venues: post-Games use”  on pages 6,7, and 8 has been used as criteria reference for the 
disclosures of the Selected Indicators. Consequently, the Selected Indicators need to be read and understood 
together with the “methodology on post-Games use of Olympic venues inventory” as described in in the IOC’s report 
”Over 125 years of Olympic venues: post-Games use” on pages 6,7, and 8. 

Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Selected Indicators 

The Selected Indicators include information based on information provided by various sources that are subject to 
inherent uncertainty because of limitations described in chapter “Study Limitations” of the IOC’s report ”Over 125 
years of Olympic venues: post-Games use” on page 8. 

Furthermore, due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities 
may occur in disclosures of the Selected Indicators and not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to detect 
all internal control weaknesses in the preparation of the Selected Indicators because the engagement was not 
performed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the audit procedures performed were on a test basis.

IOC’s Responsibilities 

The International Olympic Committee management is responsible for: 

- 

The preparation of the Selected Indicators in accordance with the “methodology on post-Games use of 
Olympic venues inventory” as described in in the IOC’s report ”Over 125 years of Olympic venues: 
post-Games use”  on pages 6,7, and 8.; 

-  Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation 
of the Selected Indicators that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Our Responsibilities 

We are responsible for: 

- 

- 

Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected 
Indicators are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 

Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained; and 

-  Reporting our independent conclusion to the International Olympic Committee management 

As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Selected Indicators as prepared by management, we 
are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Selected Indicators as doing so may compromise our 
independence. 

Professional Standards Applied 

We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 

Our Independence and Quality Control 

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior. 

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of 
quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 

Our work was carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners and 
sustainability experts. We remain solely responsible for our assurance conclusion.

Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion 

We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material 
misstatement of the Selected Indicators is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Selected Indicators included, among 
others: 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

Assessment of the design and implementation of systems and processes for determining, processing 
and monitoring relevant data, including the consolidation of data; 

Inquiries of employees responsible for the determination and consolidation as well as the 
implementation of internal control procedures regarding the Selected Indicators; 

Inspection of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative and 
quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced 
manner; 

Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of the 
reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected KPIs calculations; 

Assessment of the consistency of the requirements of the Selected Indicators with other information 
and of the overall presentation of the disclosures through critical reading of the IOC’s report ”Over 125 
years of Olympic venues: post-Games use”. 

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent 
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a 
reasonable assurance engagement.
