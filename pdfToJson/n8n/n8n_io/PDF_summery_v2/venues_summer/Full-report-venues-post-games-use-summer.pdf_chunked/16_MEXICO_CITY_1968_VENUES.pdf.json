The Olympic Stadium forms part of the UNAM Campus, which was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2007. The stadium's main entrance is adorned by a vast natural stone mural created by celebrated Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The Olympic Stadium set new design standards and provided the inspiration for Rome's Olympic Stadium and Tokyo's National Stadium, built respectively for the 1960 and 1964 Olympic Games. The Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome was once one of the fastest tracks in the world and saw no fewer than 30 world records set before its wooden track was replaced by a concrete one in 1997. The National Auditorium has twice been voted best international venue, receiving the Pollstar Award in the category in 2002 and the Billboard Touring Award in 2006."

Though demand was initially low, the apartments are still occupied by local residents today. They command higher prices than in other parts of the city because of their historical value. A second village (Narciso Mendoza Olympic Village) was built to house event officials and Cultural Olympiad participants. Its 686 houses and 470 apartments were also made available on the market after the Games and remain occupied today.\",\n      \"location\": \"inside\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Jalisco Stadium\",\n      \"classification\": \"Existing\",\n      \"use\": \"Football\",\n      \"status\": \"In use\",\n      \"information\": \"\",\n      \"location\": \"outside\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"León Stadium\",\n      \"classification\": \"Existing\",\n      \"use\": \"Football\",\n      \"status\": \"In use\",\n      \"information\": \"\",\n      \"location\": \"outside\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Yacht Club\",\n      \"classification\": \"Existing\",\n      \"use\": \"Sailing\",\n      \"status\": \"In use\",\n      \"information\": \"\",\n      \"location\": \"outside\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Avándaro Golf Club\",\n      \"classification\": \"Existing\",\n      \"use\": \"Eventing\",\n      \"status\": \"In use\",\n      \"information\": \"\",\n      \"location\": \"outside\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cuauhtémoc Stadium\",\n      \"classification\": \"New build\",\n      \"use\": \"Football\",\n      \"status\": \"In use\",\n      \"information\": \"\",\n      \"location\": \"outside\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"trivia\": \"The largest facility of its kind in Mexico, the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports Complex covers an area of 192 hectares. It comprises four Olympic venues: the Fernando Montes de Oca Olympic Fencing Hall, the Juan Escutia Sports Palace, the Jesús Martínez Palillo Athletics Stadium and the Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome. The Olympic Stadium forms part of the UNAM Campus, which was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2007. The stadium's main entrance is adorned by a vast natural stone mural created by celebrated Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The Olympic Stadium set new design standards and provided the inspiration for Rome's Olympic Stadium and Tokyo's National Stadium, built respectively for the 1960 and 1964 Olympic Games. The Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome was once one of the fastest tracks in the world and saw no fewer than 30 world records set before its wooden track was replaced by a concrete one in 1997. The National Auditorium has twice been voted best international venue, receiving the Pollstar Award in the category in 2002 and the Billboard Touring Award in 2006.\"\n}\n```"
