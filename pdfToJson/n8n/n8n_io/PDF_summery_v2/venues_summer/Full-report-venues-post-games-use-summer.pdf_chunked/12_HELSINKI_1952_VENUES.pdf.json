Ten of the competition venues were existing, seven were new and two were temporary. All the new venues remain in use. The two temporary venues have been dismantled, while two of the existing venues have been demolished and one has been repurposed. All but six of the venues were in Helsinki. All the remaining venues continue to be used for sport at all levels, from high- performance to recreational, and stage events ranging from world and European championships to school and grassroots events. The Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and several of the competitions, and it is still in use. The Olympic Village was built for the Games and is still in use. It was the city's second, since a first one had been built for the 1940 Games, which were cancelled after the outbreak of WWII.",
