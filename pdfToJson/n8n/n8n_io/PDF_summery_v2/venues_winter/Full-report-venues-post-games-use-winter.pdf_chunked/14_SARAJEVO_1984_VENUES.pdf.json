        "overview": "Eight competition venues were used for the Olympic Winter Games Sarajevo 1984. Six of them are still in use today, benefitting the local community, visitors and recreational and high-performance athletes alike. One of the competition venues was an existing site. The rest were built for the Games. The Olympic venues suffered damage to varying degrees during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995. Most have been restored to their original use and modernised since then, partly thanks to international support. Visitors and local residents continue to use them for a wide range of winter and summer sports.\n\nAlthough the ski jumps and sliding track can no longer be used for winter sports, the sites where they are located host a wide variety of other sporting and cultural activities. For example, the reopening, in 2018, of the cable car connecting the city to the top of Mount Trebević has allowed more people to access the area for hiking and other pursuits. Since then, the number of hotels, restaurants, recreation centres, etc. has grown alongside the number of visitors.\n\nAn existing venue, Koševo Stadium, hosted the Opening Ceremony. It continues to be used as a venue for track and field, football and rugby. The Olympic Hall of the newly built Zetra Complex staged the Closing Ceremony. A multi-purpose facility, it is used for sports and other events.\n\nAn Olympic Village was built for the Games, in the Mojmilo district. It was renovated after the war and is fully occupied today.",
