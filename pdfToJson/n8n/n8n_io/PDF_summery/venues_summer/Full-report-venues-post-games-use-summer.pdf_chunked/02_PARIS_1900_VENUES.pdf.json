Eleven of the competition venues were existing, one was new and three were temporary, all of which have since been dismantled along with four of the existing venues. The one new venue is still in use, as are seven of the existing venues. Many of the remaining venues are home to sports clubs and provide recreational and sporting facilities for their members and visitors.\n\nFour of the venues were later used at the Olympic Games Paris 1924: the Vélodrome de Vincennes, the Terrain de Polo de Bagatelle, the Palais de la Société des Régates du Havre, and the Cercle de la Voile de Paris.\n\nNo Opening or Closing Ceremonies were held at the Games, which ran for more than five months and were held as part of the 1900 Paris World's Fair. In the absence of an Olympic Stadium, the main venue was the Vélodrome de Vincennes, which hosted six sports in all. There was no official Olympic Village.",
