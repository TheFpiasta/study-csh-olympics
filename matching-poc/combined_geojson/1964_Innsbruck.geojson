The hill also hosted the ski jumping events at the 1985 and 2019 Nordic World Ski Championships and the inaugural Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012, when it again staged the Opening Ceremony.\n\nFormerly a regular stop on the summertime FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix tour, the Bergiselschanze is a year-round ski jumping training centre used by Austria's national ski jumping team, other national teams from around the world, and three local ski clubs. The venue plays host to other winter sports such as snowboarding and freestyle skiing. Its spectator area is used as an open-air theatre in the summer and hosted the Innsbruck Fan Zone at UEFA Euro 2008.",
