It also staged over 150 college American football games and was used by NBA team the Atlanta Hawks for two seasons in the late 1990s. Used as a concert venue as well, it welcomed major acts such as the Rolling Stones and Beyoncé. The Dome's replacement is the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. This multi-purpose venue is home to NFL team the Atlanta Falcons and MLS team Atlanta United FC. The exact site of the Georgia Dome is occupied by a parking lot and public park.

Temporary Games facilities included grandstands on a floating platform, tents and an athlete day village. These were all removed afterwards. The venue underwent a USD 1.1m renovation in 2014/15. The venue continues to host rowing and canoeing events. Since the Games, it has staged three US Canoe/Kayak Sprint National Championships, the 2003 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, and Canadian and US team trials, among other international and national competitions. The venue is shared by the Lake Lanier Rowing Club and the Lanier Canoe and Kayak Club, which run youth development sessions and high-performance training and also offer boat rentals and recreational paddling trips around Lake Lanier. Both clubs organise regular competitions and events for their members. The venue can also be booked for corporate events, conferences, teambuilding sessions, and private functions and weddings.

Whitewater racing events have been held on the Ocoee since 1977. The riverbed was re-channelled to create the Olympic course, which was one-third the width of the watercourse, with designers using banks to \"build a river within a river\". The Ocoee Whitewater Center building was erected for the Games and temporary seating for 14,000 people installed. The venue has no permanent seating. The hanging slalom gates used at the Games were later removed. Due to a combination of dams and powerhouses, the upper Ocoee is dry for most of the year, except for scheduled water releases in the summer. As a result, the course is filled with water on only 34 days a year, on weekends between May and September. The course staged some whitewater competitions in the years immediately after the Games, and there are plans to bring regular events back to the venue, which has hosted the Ocoee River Championships every August since 2018. When the river has water, commercial rafting companies take more than 750 passengers down the course every day. It is also used for swift water rescue courses. When there is no water, the centre offers alternative activities such as hiking, mountain biking and nature walks. It also organises conferences, weddings, corporate retreats, private gatherings and conservation courses for schools. The site and its visitor centre receive 300,000 visitors a year.",
