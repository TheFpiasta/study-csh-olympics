Boasting an avant-garde design that earned it several architectural awards, it was open on one side, in line with the International Skating Union's (ISU) regulations at the time. The arena's roof was insulated in 1982 to reduce energy costs. This had the unintended effect, however, of preventing the snow that accumulated on the roof from melting. In March 1983, the build-up of snow caused the roof to collapse, causing over USD 1 million in damage. The arena was demolished later in the year and the site is now a car park serving the ski resort."

There was no great tradition of ski jumping in the western USA at the time, and the venue was little used in the years after the Games. It staged a few regional competitions and underwent some refurbishment for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships.
