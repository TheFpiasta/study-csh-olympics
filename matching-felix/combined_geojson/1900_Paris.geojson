Two more courts were opened in Neuilly in the years immediately afterwards, as the popularity of the game spread, with new clubs being founded and the game finding its way into schools. This popularity quickly faded in the Neuilly area, however, leading to the closure of the Rue Pauline Borghèse court in 1906. By 1912, Neuilly's two other courts had also closed, while a fourth opened in 1913 only to shut down a year later."
