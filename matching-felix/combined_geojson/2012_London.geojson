With a view to the stadium's post-Games reconfiguration, removable features were installed, and the weight of the structures was kept to a minimum. This reconfiguration took place between 2013 and 2016. A new roof covering all the seats was installed, along with retractable seating to cover the athletics track and bring the crowd closer to the pitch. The capacity was reduced from 80,000 to approximately 60,000, though the venue can host 80,000 for concerts. As well as hosting the 2017 IAAF World Championships and matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the stadium became the new home ground of English Premier League club West Ham United, ensuring its continued use. Despite its revamp, the stadium has been criticised because of high post-Games refurbishment costs, and the deal struck between the Mayor of London and West Ham United, which some believe has left taxpayers to fund a high amount of the club's stadium operating costs."
