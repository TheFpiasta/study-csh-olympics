Track workers from the Yanqing National Sliding Centre, which staged the bobsleigh, luge and skeleton events at Beijing 2022, visited the Centre for one such workshop, with another being held for local residents and students, some of whom were then recruited as assistant ice-makers.\n\nVisitors to the Centre can try out bobsleigh in the summer and winter, among other activities.
