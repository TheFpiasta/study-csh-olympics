Construction costs were thus reduced and the risk of the run being under-used after the Games averted. Built with snow and ice, this natural run was 1.5km long and comprised 13 curves. It was never used for bobsleigh again after the Games but was turned into a luge run as planned and hosted the 1955 Luge World Championships. The track was not rebuilt after this. A 2km public sledge run was later constructed, partly following the outline of the track, and remains popular with both tourists and locals."
