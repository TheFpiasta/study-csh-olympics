Prior to that, the Stade Olympique de Colombes hosted 42 French Cup finals in football and 79 national team matches. It was also a major rugby venue, welcoming the French national team on 87 occasions – the last time in 1972 – and being used by Top 14 team Racing 92 as its home ground until 2017. Now known as Stade Yves-du-Manoir, it is being refurbished for the Olympic Games Paris 2024, when it will be used for the field hockey competitions."

New stone stands were built that year, while the tracks were improved and the facilities upgraded between 1967 and 1975. Auteuil is the venue for all of France's nine Group 1 hurdle and steeplechase races. The highlights of the racecourse's calendar include International Jump Weekend in November and the Grand SteepleChase de Paris in June. In 2020, it staged 222 races."
