The JSON correctly includes all venues from the PDF's detailed tables.\n\n3. **Individual venues**: I'll verify each venue's details:\n   - All venue names match the PDF\n   - All classifications (Existing/New/Temporary) match\n   - All uses/sports match\n   - All current statuses match\n   - The detailed information provided matches the PDF descriptions\n\n4. **Trivia section**: The trivia content matches exactly with the \"DID YOU KNOW?\" section in the PDF.\n\n5. **Overall accuracy**: The JSON appears to accurately reflect all the information from the PDF document. The venue count discrepancy seems to be due to the PDF overview referring to \"competition venues\" while the detailed tables include the Olympic Village (accommodation facility).\n\nAll data appears to be correctly extracted from the PDF.\n</scratchpad>\n\n<response>\n{\n\"status\":\"valid\"\n}\n</response>"
