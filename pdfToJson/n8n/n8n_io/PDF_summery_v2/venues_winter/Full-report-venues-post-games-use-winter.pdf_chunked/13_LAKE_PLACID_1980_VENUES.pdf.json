They all remain in use, providing first-class facilities for recreational and high-performance sport, and welcoming the local community and visitors alike. Three of the competition venues were existing and renovated for the occasion; one of them – the 1932 Jack Shea Arena – was used when Lake Placid hosted the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, in 1932. The other four were built for the 1980 Games, although three of them featured new facilities built to upgrade venues used for the 1932 Games, using the same footprint. The Field House International Ice Rink, a competition venue still in use, also hosted the Closing Ceremony. The Opening Ceremony was held at a standalone temporary venue dismantled after the Games, on the Lake Placid Equestrian Stadium ground. The Olympic Village built for the Games remains in use, as a prison, as planned in the bid.",
