          "overview": "Sixteen competition venues were used for the Olympic Games Melbourne / Stockholm 1956.\n\nThree of them were in Stockholm, which hosted the equestrian competition due to Australian quarantine regulations at the time. Eleven of the venues were existing, one was temporary and four were new, two of which are no longer in use and one of which has been repurposed. Ten of the venues have been confirmed as being in use, with data unavailable as to the current status of the Royal Australian Air Force Station. The Australian city's remaining Olympic venues perform a variety of functions, from exhibition spaces and concert venues to iconic sporting stadiums and facilities used by sports clubs.\n\nStockholm's Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the equestrian events (held in June 1956), and the Melbourne Cricket Ground performed the same function at the Games proper. The Melbourne Olympic Village was built for the Games, while Stockholm had two Olympic Villages, both of which were existing. All three remain in use.",

In preparation for Munich 1972, a sculpted concrete floor was created in the channel and the course was made steeper. Water flow from the weir at the top of the channel can be controlled to provide the necessary canoeing conditions. As a result, the course does not use pumps, making it more cost-efficient to run.

The riverbed was re-channelled to create the Olympic course, which was one-third the width of the watercourse, with designers using banks to \"build a river within a river\". The Ocoee Whitewater Center building was erected for the Games and temporary seating for 14,000 people installed. The venue has no permanent seating. The hanging slalom gates used at the Games were later removed.\n\nDue to a combination of dams and powerhouses, the upper Ocoee is dry for most of the year, except for scheduled water releases in the summer. As a result, the course is filled with water on only 34 days a year, on weekends between May and September. The course staged some whitewater competitions in the years immediately after the Games, and there are plans to bring regular events back to the venue, which has hosted the Ocoee River Championships every August since 2018.\n\nWhen the river has water, commercial rafting companies take more than 750 passengers down the course every day. It is also used for swift water rescue courses. When there is no water, the centre offers alternative activities such as hiking, mountain biking and nature walks. It also organises conferences, weddings, corporate retreats, private gatherings and conservation courses for schools. The site and its visitor centre receive 300,000 visitors a year."
