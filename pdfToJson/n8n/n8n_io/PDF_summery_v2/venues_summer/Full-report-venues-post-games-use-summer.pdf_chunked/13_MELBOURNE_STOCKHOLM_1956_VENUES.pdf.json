Eleven of the venues were existing, one was temporary and four were new, two of which are no longer in use and one of which has been repurposed. Ten of the venues have been confirmed as being in use, with data unavailable as to the current status of the Royal Australian Air Force Station. The Australian city's remaining Olympic venues perform a variety of functions, from exhibition spaces and concert venues to iconic sporting stadiums and facilities used by sports clubs.\n\nStockholm's Olympic Stadium hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the equestrian events (held in June 1956), and the Melbourne Cricket Ground performed the same function at the Games proper. The Melbourne Olympic Village was built for the Games, while Stockholm had two Olympic Villages, both of which were existing. All three remain in use.",
