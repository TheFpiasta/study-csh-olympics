Aside from one temporary venue, all the other competition venues were existing. No Olympic Village was built either, out of a desire to keep costs low in a country still recovering from WWII. Of the nine venues no longer in use, five are football stadiums. The temporary venue was dismantled after the Games.\n\nEmpire Stadium, now Wembley Stadium, hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the athletics competitions. Two of the venues had been used at the 1908 Olympic Games (Henley Royal Regatta Course and Bisley Rifle Range), while three were used at London 2012: Empire Stadium (Wembley), Empire Pool (Wembley Arena) and Empress Hall (Earl's Court).",
