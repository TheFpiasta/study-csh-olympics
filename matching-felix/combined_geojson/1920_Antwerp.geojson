The stadium project included the construction of a new grandstand, the enlarging of existing grandstands, the extension of the track and the building of an access road. At Games time, the stadium had a capacity of 35,000. Following the Games, further work was carried out to convert the stadium into a football ground for the club K Beerschot VA. In 2000, the venue underwent a major refurbishment. The running track was removed, four separate stands were created, and the capacity was reduced to 13,000. The club still plays its home games at the stadium, though no other major events have taken place there since the 1920 Olympic Games."
