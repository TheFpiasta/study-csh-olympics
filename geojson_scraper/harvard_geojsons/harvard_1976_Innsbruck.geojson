A ski jumping site since 1927, when a wooden jump was erected, it was upgraded for the 1964 Olympic Winter Games and again for Innsbruck 1976. Parts of the Bergisel site are protected by cultural heritage status. The Bergiselschanze is the venue for the third round of the world-famous annual Four Hills Tournament, which is held in early January and attracts sell-out crowds of 28,000. The hill also hosted the ski jumping events at the 1985 and 2019 Nordic World Ski Championships and the inaugural Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012, when it again staged the Opening Ceremony. Formerly a regular stop on the summertime FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix tour, the Bergiselschanze is a year-round ski jumping training centre used by Austria's national ski jumping team, other national teams from around the world, and three local ski clubs. The venue plays host to other winter sports such as snowboarding and freestyle skiing. Its spectator area is used as an open-air theatre in the summer and hosted the Innsbruck Fan Zone at UEFA Euro 2008.",
