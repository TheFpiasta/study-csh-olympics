You will be given a large list of names. Your task is to extract specific terms and categorize them according to the following categories:

1. Stadium-specific terms and their synonyms
2. Location indicators
3. Filler words

Here is the list of names:

<name_list>
{{NAME_LIST}}
</name_list>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Analyze the list of names and identify words that fall into the following categories:

   a) Stadium-specific terms: Words that refer to sports venues, such as "stadium", "park", "field", "arena", etc., and their synonyms in various languages.

   b) Location indicators: Common words used in place names that indicate location or ownership, such as "di", "del", "van", "von", etc.

   c) Filler words: Common words that don't contribute to the core meaning of a name, such as "also", "known", "as", etc.

2. For stadium-specific terms, group synonyms together. Include translations in different languages if present.

3. For location indicators and filler words, simply list all unique words you find.

4. Organize your findings in the following format:

<output>
# Stadium-specific terms and their synonyms
stadium_terms = {
    'term1': ['synonym1', 'synonym2', ...],
    'term2': ['synonym1', 'synonym2', ...],
    ...
}

# Common location indicators
location_indicators = {
    'word1', 'word2', 'word3', ...
}

# Common filler words
filler_words = {
    'word1', 'word2', 'word3', ...
}
</output>

Make sure to include only the extracted terms in your final output. Do not include any explanations, thought processes, or additional text outside of the specified format.
