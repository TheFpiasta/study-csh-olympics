A football, track and field and concert venue, it is the home stadium of AEK Athens and Greece's national football team and staged the 1983 UEFA European Cup final, the 2007 UEFA Champions League final and the 1997 World Championships in Athletics. Madonna, Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga are just some of the major singers and bands to have performed there. AEK's home games have been attracting relatively low attendances – just over 14,000 in the 2018/19 season."
