The stadium has provided the setting for two Super Bowls, several World Series baseball matches, and four US Olympic track and field trials. The Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Dodgers are just some of the many sports teams that have called the stadium home at some time or other in its history. Figures such as John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and Billy Graham have all addressed large crowds at the Los Angeles Olympic Stadium, which has also played host to the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Bruce Springsteen and Prince, among other major acts.
