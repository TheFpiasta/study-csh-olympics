Its famous Century range – so called because it comprises 100 targets – was converted for the Games. Bisley has been home to the National Rifle Association since 1890. The venue retains its original clubhouses and layout today, and its ranges remain largely similar. A new range – Cheylesmore – was laid out for the 1948 Olympic Games, and in more recent times Bisley hosted all the shooting events at the 2002 Commonwealth Games."
