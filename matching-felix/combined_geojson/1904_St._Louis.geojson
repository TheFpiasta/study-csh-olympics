In 1984, the stadium underwent its first major renovation, with the original cinder track replaced by a 400-metre artificial track. The seating capacity of its original reinforced concrete stands was also reduced to 4,000. The stadium was further refurbished in 2003 and 2004, when an artificial pitch was installed. By this time, Francis Field was also home to the university's women's and men's soccer, track and field, and cross-country teams. Francis Field Stadium is the oldest Olympic stadium still in regular use for official sporting events and is also a registered historic landmark. In September 2018, a structure featuring the Olympic rings was erected nearby to provide a permanent reminder of the stadium's Olympic status, a function also performed by the ornamental wrought-iron gate installed after the Games at the east entrance to the stadium. A year later, the venue was renamed Francis Olympic Field, to recognise its place in Olympic history."

The building, which was also extended to incorporate new facilities, was renamed the Gary M. Sumers Recreation Centre. During its renovation, parts of the original gymnasium were demolished. Some elements were retained, however. These include the gym's original maple flooring, which was relaid in a bridge section connecting the existing and new parts of the facility. Among the centre's many exercise spaces is the Olympic Studio, which celebrates the venue's Olympic past and whose walls are lined with photographs from the 1904 Games. The venue has also played a part in recent US political history, providing the setting for five presidential and vice-presidential debates since 1992."
