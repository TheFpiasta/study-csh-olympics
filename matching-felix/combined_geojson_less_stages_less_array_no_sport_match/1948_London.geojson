The stadium has on occasion provided London football clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur with a temporary home, and it has been used for several other sports over the years, including rugby league, rugby union, American football, speedway, boxing and baseball. It is also a celebrated concert venue and was the setting for the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. It also hosts corporate events and offers guided tours for visitors. One of the two physical remnants of the 1948 Olympic Games is Olympic Way, since renamed Wembley Way. A half-mile approach to the stadium leading from the nearest London Underground station, it was built for the Games and channels spectators in their thousands to the stadium's gates. The other is the Olympic Roll of Honour, two large plaques commemorating the gold medallists at the 1948 Olympic Games and set in the walls on either side of the Royal Tunnel. The plaques were removed and kept safe when the stadium was demolished in 2003 and returned to Wembley in time for the 2012 Olympic Games, as part of an exhibition at the new stadium."

It enjoyed its heyday in the 1920s and 30s, when events such as the Good Friday Meeting attracted crowds of up to 12,000. Though in regular use after the 1948 Olympic Games, it was threatened with closure in 2010 due to the poor state of the facilities. The velodrome was extensively refurbished between 2011 and 2017, when the 450m banked asphalt track received a completely new surface, floodlights were installed, and a new pavilion was built to accommodate new changing rooms, offices, a café and bike storage facilities. It was London's only velodrome until the construction of Lee Valley VeloPark for the 2012 Olympic Games."
