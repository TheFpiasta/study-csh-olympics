Twelve of the competition venues were existing, one was new and one was temporary. The new venue has since been demolished, along with four of the existing ones. Most of the venues that remain in use are sports clubs, with several of them hosting major competitions and providing recreational and competitive sport for their members. The new venue was the London Olympic Stadium, where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies were held. Also known as White City Stadium, it was the main centre of the Games. It was regularly used for over 55 years before being demolished in 1984. There was no official Olympic Village. Only two of the venues were used again when London staged the 1948 Olympic Games: Henley Royal Regatta Course and Bisley Rifle Range.",
