The hill was completely rebuilt in 2007 and underwent renovation work again in 2019.\n\nIt is the venue for the second round of the world-famous Four Hills Tournament, a ski jumping competition that takes place between Christmas and Epiphany and attracts crowds of over 25,000 spectators in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It has also staged many FIS World Cup and Continental Cup events and the German National Ski Jumping Championships. Also used for youth and regional competitions, it is open for training five days a week and is visited annually by between 400,000 and 600,000 people. Its attractions include guided tours, a restaurant and a zipline running from the tower to the stadium area."
