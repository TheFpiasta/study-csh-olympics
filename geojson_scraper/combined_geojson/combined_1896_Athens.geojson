The popularity of cycling began to decline in Greece, however, and the track was abandoned. In 1925, the velodrome was converted into a football ground and the track removed. Eleven years later, the venue was renamed Karaiskakis Stadium. The home ground of the football club Olympiacos, it hosted several other sports as well. In 2003, it made way for a new Karaiskakis Stadium, which staged several football matches at the Olympic Games Athens 2004.",
