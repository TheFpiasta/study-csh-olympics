The Grenoble 1968 Olympic cauldron still stands in the Parc Paul Mistral today. A stand-alone venue that hosted the men's large hill competition, the ski jumping hill at Saint-Nizier was built in such a way that ski jumpers appeared to be flying over nearby Grenoble when they took off. The images caught by the world's photographers at the Olympic Winter Games helped market the city and promote it as the \"Capital of the Alps\". The Olympic ice hockey matches held at the Stade de Glace and the Patinoire Municipale attracted sellout crowds and provided a springboard for ice hockey in France. Participation numbers rose after the Games and new ice hockey clubs were founded. There are now more than 80 across France."
