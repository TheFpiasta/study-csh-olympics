A year-round competition and training venue, the complex boasts K-120 and K-90 ski jump towers and two training hills. It has hosted a variety of international ski jumping events over the years, including events at the 2019 International Children's Winter Games. Its training facilities are used by the US ski team's Elite Aerial Development Program (EADP). The complex, which also comprises a Nordic ski loop and biathlon range, is being upgraded to meet the FIS' highest requirements for staging events. As part of the refurbishment, beginners' slopes and a freeride and tubing park will be built to encourage more local residents to use the site."
