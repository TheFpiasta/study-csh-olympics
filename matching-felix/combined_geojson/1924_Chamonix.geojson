The local sports club continued to use the site for training until the early 1960s, at which point the City of Chamonix withdrew the concession and the track was abandoned.\n\nParts of the 1.3km course, which runs through a forest and sits at the foot of the Glacier des Pélerins, remain visible today. The track is now frequented by hikers and cyclists, though there have been calls for the local authorities to renovate it, commemorate its Olympic past and attract more visitors to the site."

It underwent four modifications through to 1982 but lost its FIS accreditation in 2001 and hosted its last international competition that winter. Efforts were later made to raise funds to upgrade the venue and bring it into line with FIS requirements, but these failed when priority was given instead to another ski jumping facility nearby.",
