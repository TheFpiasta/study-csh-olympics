Three of the competition venues were existing, three were new and one was temporary. Along with the temporary venue, one of the new venues has been demolished. The three existing venues all remain in use. Most of the venues continue to host elite sporting events, with two of them staging competitions at the Olympic Games Athens 2004 and a third used as the main communications centre for that event. Some are also open to visitors and host events such as conferences and concerts. An eighth venue was set up to host the Athens 1896 rowing competition,but this was cancelled due to stormy conditions. The venue is still in use. An existing venue, the Panathenaic Stadium, served as the Olympic Stadium, staging the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and several of the competitions. There was no official Olympic Village.",

The stadium has since hosted a number of sporting and cultural events, including the first Balkan Games in 1929, the opening ceremony of the 1997 IAAF World Championships, and the archery competitions and the finish of the men's and women's marathons at the Olympic Games Athens 2004. Every two years, the stadium is also the venue for the official handover of the Olympic flame to the organisers of the next Olympic Summer or Winter Games. In April 2010, it opened to the public and became a visitor attraction, offering educational programmes for schools and tours. It is also a concert venue."
