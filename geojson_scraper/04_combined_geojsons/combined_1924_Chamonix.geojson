The local sports club continued to use the site for training until the early 1960s, at which point the City of Chamonix withdrew the concession and the track was abandoned.\n\nParts of the 1.3km course, which runs through a forest and sits at the foot of the Glacier des Pélerins, remain visible today. The track is now frequented by hikers and cyclists, though there have been calls for the local authorities to renovate it, commemorate its Olympic past and attract more visitors to the site.",
