        "venue_information": "France's national sliding sports training centre hosts international competitions nearly every year, including a round of the 2020 IBSF Bobsleigh World Cup. As planned when it was built, the venue is also open to the general public for beginners' bobsleigh and luge activities. It is visited by approximately 14,000 people a year. La Plagne, the resort where the sliding track is located, is the world's most-frequented ski resort. In 2003, the sliding centre in La Plagne became the first in the world to switch from ammonia to safer glycol refrigeration piping."
