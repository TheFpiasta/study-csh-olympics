        "information": "The venue for ice hockey, figure skating and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, this 11,000-capacity arena was a much-used and popular skating venue and a training base for the United States' leading figure skaters. Boasting an avant-garde design that earned it several architectural awards, it was open on one side, in line with the International Skating Union's (ISU) regulations at the time. The arena's roof was insulated in 1982 to reduce energy costs. This had the unintended effect, however, of preventing the snow that accumulated on the roof from melting. In March 1983, the build-up of snow caused the roof to collapse, causing over USD 1 million in damage. The arena was demolished later in the year and the site is now a car park serving the ski resort.",
