Nine out of the 10 permanent venues are still in use and remain integral to grassroots and high-performance sport in the Oslo area. Thanks to the Norwegian capital's longstanding tradition of hosting winter sports events and its flourishing recreational and competitive winter sports scene, nine of the competition venues were existing sites. Of the other two venues, one was built for the Games, and the other was temporary. Bislett Stadium was the main venue for the Games and hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, as well as the speed skating, figure skating and bandy events. It has since been repurposed, becoming a leading track and field venue. Three official Olympic Villages were built for the Games, all of them in Oslo and with clear post-Games use plans. All of them are still in use today, providing accommodation for students, hospital staff and the elderly.",
