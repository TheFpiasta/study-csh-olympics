Some sections of the lower seating are movable, enabling the switch from a rectangular playing area for rugby and football matches to an oval one for Australian Rules Football and cricket matches. Though the New South Wales government announced plans in 2017 for the stadium's demolition and the construction of a new stadium on the site, it later reversed its decision and went ahead with a refurbishment. Focused on the fans, an investment of more than AUD 10 million was made to enhance the event experience at the stadium through digital upgrades like the installation of one of the longest straight-run stadium video screens.\n\nMore than 27 million people have attended events at the venue since it opened in March 1999. The stadium is currently home to three rugby league teams (New South Wales Blues, Canterbury Bulldogs and South Sydney Rabbitohs), a rugby union team (New South Wales Waratahs) and the national teams for football (Socceroos) and rugby (Wallabies). It hosts more than 50 events every calendar year, making it one of the busiest stadiums in Australia."
