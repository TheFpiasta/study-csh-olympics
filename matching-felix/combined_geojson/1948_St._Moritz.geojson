The run also hosts Switzerland's national bobsleigh, skeleton and toboggan championships and several local events, including the Hornschlitten – a traditional toboggan race. It is open from the end of December to the beginning of March and is used for training by amateur and high-performance athletes and by the Sankt Moritz Bobsleigh Club, founded in 1897.
