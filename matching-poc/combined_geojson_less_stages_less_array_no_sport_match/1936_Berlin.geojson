The stadium forms part of Berlin Olympic Park, which was known as the Reichssportfeld at Games time and is also home to the May Field, the Hockey Stadium, the Tennis Courts and Tennis Stadium, the Swimming Stadium and the Waldbühne. Occupied by British troops at the end of WWII, the stadium was returned to the local authorities in 1949. In 1966, it was listed as a historical monument. The stadium then underwent a number of modifications and renovations, the most extensive coming in the early 2000s, in preparation for the 2006 football World Cup, when the lower ring was rebuilt and two rows of seats and a roof were added. Used mostly as a football venue since the war, it has been the home stadium of Hertha BSC since 1963. Berlin Olympic Stadium has hosted the German Cup Final since 1985. A venue at the 1974 World Cup, it also staged the final of the 2006 World Cup and the opening match of the 2011 Women's World Cup. Also a major track and field venue, it staged the 2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and the 2018 European Athletics Championships. Several major acts have performed at the venue, among them Madonna, Depeche Mode and Coldplay."

It has also staged boxing matches and an infamous 1965 concert by the Rolling Stones, which ended in a riot that caused extensive damage to the venue. It was not used again until its renovation seven years later. Modelled on an Ancient Greek amphitheatre, the Waldbühne has a roofed stage and lighting for evening performances. One of the most popular open-air theatres in the world, it was ranked Europe's best amphitheatre in 2019 by a respected concert-industry magazine."
