In an effort to host as many events as possible at the stadium, the Organising Committee constructed a swimming pool and diving tower, a banked cycle track around the athletics track, and a pitch on the infield for football, hockey, rugby and lacrosse matches. The swimming pool and tower were dismantled after the Games, when the venue became known as White City Stadium. The stadium was used sporadically in the years immediately after the Games, but began staging greyhound races in 1927. It continued to do so up until its demolition in 1984. It was also a venue for rugby, American football, boxing, speedway, football and athletics. Queens Park Rangers FC used it as their home ground for brief periods in the 1930s and 1960s, while the British Amateur Athletic Association Championships were held there from 1932 to 1971. In 1934, the stadium hosted the British Empire Games (the forerunner of the Commonwealth Games), and it was also the venue for the match between France and Uruguay at the 1966 football World Cup. Following the stadium's demolition, the site was occupied by administrative and commercial buildings. Westfield London shopping centre also occupies part of the White City site.",
