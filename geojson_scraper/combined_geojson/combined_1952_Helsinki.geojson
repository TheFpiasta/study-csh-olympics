A Helsinki landmark, it is home to the Sports Museum of Finland and is Finland's largest outdoor arena. It has staged the IAAF World Athletics Championships twice and the European Athletics Championships three times. The venue for the final of the UEFA Women's Euro 2009, the stadium is also the home ground of the Finnish national men's and women's football teams and Helsinki club HJK. It plays host to the country's cup finals and will be the venue for the 2022 UEFA Super Cup. A multi-purpose facility, it has hosted more than 20 sports over the years. In winter months, the pitch is converted into an ice rink for use by the community, and various winter sports are played there. Throughout the year, the stadium is used extensively for community and school events such as carnivals, youth fun runs and snow festivals, and welcomes around 600,000 visitors a year. A number of major international pop and rock groups and acts have performed there. In 2019, the stadium underwent an extensive refurbishment and was fitted out with artist and athlete lounges, stakeholder and media spaces, a new visitors' centre, a restaurant, multi-functional conference rooms, and new VIP and corporate boxes. Safety improvements were also made.",

In recent times, the velodrome has been deemed unsuitable for official elite International Cycling Union (UCI) events due to its unconventional length (400m) and outdated safety standards.
