Strong winds made safety an issue, especially with athletes jumping ever higher and further. When the FIS introduced new regulations in 1990, the hill was closed and subsequently abandoned. It is now in a state of disrepair.

Situated nearby, it comprises seven eight- to 10-storey buildings with 512 apartments. Complete with a gymnasium, cultural centre, village hall and shopping centre, it offers both social housing and private apartments. To mark the 50th anniversary of these Olympic Winter Games, a giant mural covering an area of 300 square metres was painted on the side of one of the Media Centre buildings. Based on inputs from local residents, it features scenes from the Games, including a portrait of the great French skier Jean-Claude Killy, who won three Alpine skiing gold medals at Grenoble 1968. The Grenoble 1968 Olympic cauldron still stands in the Parc Paul Mistral today. A stand-alone venue that hosted the men's large hill competition, the ski jumping hill at Saint-Nizier was built in such a way that ski jumpers appeared to be flying over nearby Grenoble when they took off. The images caught by the world's photographers at the Olympic Winter Games helped market the city and promote it as the \\\"Capital of the Alps\\\". The Olympic ice hockey matches held at the Stade de Glace and the Patinoire Municipale attracted sellout crowds and provided a springboard for ice hockey in France. Participation numbers rose after the Games and new ice hockey clubs were founded. There are now more than 80 across France.\"\n}\n```"

For example, the reopening, in 2018, of the cable car connecting the city to the top of Mount Trebević has allowed more people to access the area for hiking and other pursuits. Since then, the number of hotels, restaurants, recreation centres, etc. has grown alongside the number of visitors.\n\nAn existing venue, Koševo Stadium, hosted the Opening Ceremony. It continues to be used as a venue for track and field, football and rugby. The Olympic Hall of the newly built Zetra Complex staged the Closing Ceremony.
